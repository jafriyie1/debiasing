Remember when the highest upvoted post you saw in a week had 5000 points?
"EDIT: For those that are just getting to this post and are confused, when I posted this comment the OP was over 21,000 points."
"Yes, I know it currently says 11,000 total votes."
"As many people replied to me, reddit's algorithms fudge the votes in interesting ways to try to keep the front page changing."
"EDIT 2: Yes ladies and gents, I know where it's at now."
Insane.
Can't wait to upvote this 17 different times later this week.
Nice watermark PP.
Clever.
The mirrored text brought this to a different level.

Thank you /u/iH8myPP for wasting your weekend so we may smile on a Monday.
I didn't realize how much I missed Groot until now.

"Great job, OP."
I can't wait to see how may reposts this gets with your watermark.

I have no words to describe my reaction when I woke up this morning and saw this.
"All I can say is, ""Thank you!"

I already posted this 3 months from now

Hey I know that username - haven't seen you outside of Imgur before!
Reposts help people who missed the content the first time get a chance to see it.
What we need are reposts that give credit to the original posts.
Give credit where credit is due.
Has the karma scoring system changed?
"That's the highest upvoted post I've ever seen - 19,698 just now!"
How'd this go from 22k upvotes down to 15k upvotes?
So u/GallowBoob is baby Groot?
Horeeshet
I can already see it now .
"r/memeeconomy - ""invest now in lil groot -  'I made this'!"
lol love this.
Can't wait for the movie.

Baby Groot is the cutest.
What.
Didnt this have like 19000 upvotes?
How come its at 7000 now?
I've got a sneaking suspicion this is a repost.
but I'll upvote it anyways
And thus a legendary gif has been born.
is this the original or did i upvote a copy/paste?
Holy fuck this went from 20000 upvotes to only 12000!
Can someone explain why posts upvotes go down so much over like a couple hours?
"This was at 21k + earlier, and is now at 10k."
"Didn't this hit 20,000 up votes earlier?"
"I refuse to believe that 10,000 people down voted this."
There's no fucking way.
"Saw this at 20,000 upvotes and now it's at 9,000 :( does anyone know where it peaked?"
Stupid question: How are people making the captions float with the movement in the frame?
Is it a plugin for after effects or something?
"Wow this is some next level shit, nice work man"
I don't know if I have ever seen something with so many upvotes on the front page
Why is this post losing upvotes like wildfire?
How has this come from 19000 up votes to 9000?
I like reposts.
It's sometimes fun to see a raccoon lose his cotton candy or a kangaroo get punched by an Aussie or a comic of a dog finding out he's a good boy.
This is reddit history happening right here.
And I wanna he part of it.
"This has gone from 21000 upvotes, to 17000, now it's at 11000"
"PP I had no idea you beat Barack Obama's AMA, I love seeing your stuff on HQG."
Good job!
I really wish this was a repost
Back in my day this had 20k upvotes
"This post has almost 200K upvotes, wtf?"
during the movie this was the only thing i could think about.
186k upvotes?
There seems to be a disturbance in the force.
So this wins right?
This gif just won Reddit.
All of it.
19K Upvotes -> 9K Upvotes Couple Hours LaterEdit: Word
wait didnt this have like 18k?
edit: now it has like 200kgj reddit
This will get buried but my SS number is 475-1978-2209
I'll never be able to see what it is because it never loads for me.
Aaaaand now you've hit 250fuckingk.
Congratulations man.
This is still one of the best posts I've ever seen.
This still makes me laugh every time I watch it.
"And when I finally see the actual movie, I'm going to think of this post."

"At the time of writing this, the gif has 19,551 upvotes (And is only at 90% upvoted, who the hell downvotes this masterpiece?"
Is this the highest upvoted content on Reddit ever?
Holy shit I've never seen this many upvotes.
20k upvotes?
Damn.
Edit: How come it only shows 11k upvotes now.
It was displaying 20k earlier
"So this was at 20k, what happened?"
Did 12 thousand people really dislike this?

Suck it.
"This post was well over 10000 upvotes and now it's 5000, so who are the children that downvote?"
Honestly I'm surprised people defend themselves as being reposters this way
This had 21000 votes at its peak.
"Fuck Reddit's vote fuzzing, this deserves twice that."
After the new changes this post has over 180 THOUSAND upvotes.
r/jesuschristreddit
"187,000 upvotes."
Amazing
The amount of upvotes with that new algorithm; oh s^h^i^i^i^i^t
Just going to leave a comment on the most upvoted post in the history of reddit which is going to be archived.
"If you are reading this in the future (year 2017+) then thank you mom, thank you dad, thank you friends for being friends and I hope people fly everyday in the future (maybe room temperature super conductors will be practical with those nanotubes) and have ultimate/ly cheap gaming pc's, there's world peace and if you are still reading this have a good day."
Didn't think that the most upvoted post in Reddit history would be posted 3 days ago.
I have a feeling I may not be the last one.
But I'm definitely going strong
Almost missed it today.
I remembered but then got lazy and never typed anything.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THE PATRIOTS WON THE SUPERBOWL!
Hell yeah I wanna be apart of this gif that doesn't load too!
What's PP?
Upvote if you don't have the answer.
Edit: got OP to reply to my comment.
This is definitely making history.
TX OP.
History
I'm still proud of the 100 up votes I got on one of my posts
"I'm Mary Poppins, Y'all"
Why does every comment have fucking at least 20 upvotes?
"Don't mind me, just cementing my name in Reddit history."
A comment here is a piece of history.
I was here.
And I will be the last one the ever comment on this post!
I was here
There's a dark part inside of me that hopes this is a repost.
"Wow, 2 hours ago this had 20k more up votes than downvotes, now only 13k?"
So 7k people voted this down since 4:30 EST (now 7:00 EST)?
Damn that's brutal
the reverse text as Groot was running away though.
Most relevant post on reddit this entire year.
This is art
This is absolute genius and deserves all the fortune and glory it receives.
We can see the downvoting algorithm doing work.
"This was at 21000 earlier, and now it's at 14000Edit; Now at 9000"
Thanks for giving me something to make the front page with tomorrow OP.
Wow this got almost 10k down votes in a few hours.

You should do an AMA.
The fact that this is #1 is perfect.

How much karma did u get from this
Still gonna get in on this.

Quick!
Say something witty!
Memes are overrated the meme economy is a sham that'll collapse
Dude this makes me happy!
I made that bomb in real life!
(I worked on the movie)
reddit.
The president we needed.
Now time for the one we deserve.
"Here I am, at 26 years of age."
"I can safely say this will be the president I go-to when asked, ""Who would you have run our country again?"
""" for the rest of my life."
DONT FUCKING LEAVE US
"Canadian here, I'm not even a US citizen nor do i live in the States but, even I feel like I'm losing a great president after tonight."
"Thanks, Obama."
Good luck to everyone after tonight.
"This man right here, agree or disagree, knew how to speak to the American people."
He could talk about a carton of milk and it would be the most interesting speech about a carton of milk thats ever been said.
I actually am gonna miss Obama regardless of what he may have done right or wrong.
He was one of the most fun presidents I can think of.
Maybe being an internet era president helped.
They both gave us the [best memes.
"I never really had much of a horse in either race, though I didn't like Romney at all and any chance McCain had of getting my vote evaporated when they put a lunatic like Palin on his ticket."
"I like Obama as a person, though."
"I've really enjoyed having a President that genuinely seems to enjoy science and technology and nerdy pursuits, and we've had some really amazing photographs come out of the White House when he's around kids."
Has he said anything about what he plans on doing after he leaves office?
"As someone who didn't vote for Obama, and never thought I'd be saying this, I'd totally re-elect him right now if I could."
"I don't agree with a lot of his politics but there's no denying that he's been an incredibly ""presidential"" president."
He's on his game every time he comes into the public eye.
"The past 8 years we've seen him angry, we've seen him sad, and we've seen him goofing off with kids, but no matter what he always looks like a president."
That's far more than I can say for the two morons we're being stuck with now.
Republican here.
I never voted for Obama but applaud him for two things: sensible foreign policy and (as politicians go) being honest.
Thank God he kept us out of Syria and other unnecessary wars.
I disagree with virtually all of his domestic policies but he promoted them in good faith and what he thought was in the country's best interests.
"He spent eight years in the White House and despite the best effort of his political enemies, he was never impugned with any serious political controversy."
The most significant taint of dishonesty during his administration was from Hillary Clinton-- which shows you how terrible a candidate she is and how much of a decent man he was.
"I didn't agree with him, but respect him."
"In under two hours, this has been one of the most upvoted posts I have seen in my few years on Reddit."
"""Hindsight is 20/20"" as they say."
Thank Mr ObamaI also want to be the last person to post a comment before this is archived
"16 months from now, Obama's gonna get pulled over in his newish Mercedes Benz beneath the B-line on Lake Street."
"As the cop get's closer to the driver side he realizes the car's pretty hazy and as Obama rolls down the window, the smell of marijuana billows out."

MICHELLE 2028!
I'm going to miss this man so much when he's gone.
"He is the coolest president we have ever had, and he did a lot of good for this country."
More than can be expected from the situation he was given.
Let's hope the next candidate doesn't fuck up EVERYTHING.
You've been my president for half of my life.
I'm sorry I couldn't vote for you (eight was way too young!
") When I think of the president of the United States of America, I think of you."
I don't know if that will change.
My 80 year old grandmother got to see a black president.
My 40 year old mother got to see a black president.
My 7 year old cousin got to see a black president.
I got to see a black president.
"And so, from the girls who spent 10%, 20%, 50%, and 100% of their lives with you in office:Thank you so very much, Obama."
"No matter what happens, you will always be our president."
"Another Soldier here, thank you President Obama, for being all the values that this country needs."
"I love America and despite every adversity you faced, you remained a man i have always and easily been able to respect."
You really were the President this country needs.
Thank you for your service to our country Mr.
President
"President, You'll never read this but as a Soldier in the U."
"Army, I'd like to thank you very much for the past 8 years."
You are the epitome of a strong and diplomatic leader that this country deserves.
I firmly believe that you did your best despite the hatred and oppression you faced from a shockingly large number of Americans.
"Among other things, You pushed to remove troops out of a war we had erroneously entered and you believed everyone deserves health care which is very considerate and commendable."
"Thank you, Sir."
If you remember in 2008 republicans said Obama will institute Sharia Law in the US and take away all the guns from people.
Still waiting.
"If you look for yourself (and stop listening to politicians and the media), this country is a better place to live than it was 8 years ago."
Virtually every standard of living that assesses a first world country is higher in the US now than it was at the end of Bush's second term.
He wasn't perfect but God knows he's better than these two twats.
Thanks for creating the ACA.
When I was unemployed it took me 5 minutes to enroll.
My first meeting with my very awesome Doctor I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed sertraline.
My prescription cost me $0 a bottle and has been the best thing I have ever done for myself.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
My very sick wife can see doctors.
Thank you Mr.
President.
Imagine if history remembers him as the last sane president.
I'm going to to miss you and MIchelle.
Respect and love 🙏
Ugh can he just be the president for another term so we have time to get our shit together
"""Obama, come back!"
You can blame it all.
I was wrong!
And we really don't want these two!
"""Edit: My highest upvoted comment was about a cool black guy and a really good love song."
Thanks reddit!
"Genuinely, truly, for the last 8 years of economic growth and stability, thanks Obama."
Thank you so much.
"Now go enjoy every single day of your retirement, you earned it."

Everyone who completely shitted on Obama these last 8 years is gonna talk about him with such nostalgia in a decade I guarantee you
"Honestly, he'll be looked back very fondly."
"Remember people, he got that fucking sunnuvabitch Bin Laden."
"For THAT ALONE, he gets free drinks anywhere in the world."
"My brother's cancer didn't kill him, thanks to Obamacare and the clause that prevents insurance companies from giving him insurance."
"He is alive thanks to Obamacare, and every time I hear a Republican say he wants to overturn Obamacare, I hear ""I want to kill your brother."
What the fuck is this shit?
What did he do now?
Yea thanks Obama.
"u/PresidentObama if everyone in here could vote for you again, they would."
"Hope you're leaving the country in good hands, boss."

"For the amount of unwarranted shit this guy has put up with over the last 8 years, he did a fucking awesome job."
"Thank you President Obama, you were an an amazing leader."
"You know, as a conservative libertarian I swore I'd hate Obama."
(No guys I'm not a racist so chill out) 8 years later that's changed a ton.
"I don't love him, I disagree with some of his choices, but I would call his election a win."
I would in a heartbeat take 1 more year of him while we figure out some new election choices.
But unfortunately that's a no go.
I will however hate Hillary until my dying breath ;) Also trump is still a POS
He's a genuinely good guy and a great leader of the country.
Thanks Mr President.
"Mr Obama,On the off chance that you read this, there are a few things I have to say."
"I remember that for your 2008 inauguration, my whole class watched in silence and awe, I didn't know why at the time, but I felt hope welling up inside me."
"Then, in 2012, as I became a legend in my school's debate team, I did my best to copy your speech patterns to avoid using filler words."
"As I have become more politically aware, my appreciation for all of the things you have done, and rights you have secured has grown."
"Thanks to you, not only America has recovered from the Bush dynasty, but my critical thinking skills are very well developed."
"Regardless on people's stance on your policies, there is no denying that you did *your* best, and have been an extraordinarily wise, charismatic, and thoughtful president."
"Thanks Obama, we're gonna miss you."
I never thought I'd say this but I'm going to miss Obama.
"I haven't always agreed with what he's done, but he stands up for what he believes is right."
He seems like a genuinely cool guy and I think he has handled himself well in office and in the public eye.
Being President ain't easy.
"No matter who wins this election, I'm deeply worried for our country."
"Thanks Obama, I had dollars in my pocket."
Now I have change.
This kinda doesn't make sense to me as a Canadian.
"for 8 years all it seemed like the Americans did was say ""thanks Obama"" and blame everything on him."
"New president comes in and like a bunch of little children it's ""please Obama don't go!"
We will miss you!
""" It's so weak."
I miss him so much
OBAMA I love you
"Yep, we miss you."
GFY Obama!
Good riddance!
"Last night I discovered r/the_donald, a subreddit about Donald Trump that has been banned from ever reaching r/all."
Meanwhile this post is a top post.
"Reddit calls itself the front page of the Internet, and the Internet is a place where people can freely express themselves."
"People either like your stuff and tune in or ignore you, but the important thing to note is that the people decide."
"Go back to your original intention, reddit."
Be the front page of the Internet again.
Edited: spelled the Donald subreddit wrong.
"Absolute living legend, it sucks that he has to go :("
Gonna cry.
I am 14 years old.
"Obama is the only President that I have ever really known, being only 6 when was elected in 2008."
I'm going to miss him.
He doesn’t get enough credit for all the credit he gave us
"Now pardon Snowden on your way out, please."
"I tought this post had like 25000+ upvotes yesterday, what happened?"
He was an amazing president.
Glad he's gone.
"Never did a damn thing in office, but steal money from the people."
What a damn joke.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
I thought not.
It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.
It’s a Sith legend.
"Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying."
"Thanks, Obama"
"That was probably the first time we all said ""Thanks Obama""unironically"
I admit he did not do much for me.
My life did not change at all.
"But the one thing that will change, is that on Dec 1st, my company has to start paying me overtime."
"I have to work overtime, it is part of the job and a lot of it."
I am going to go from 37K to 45K and I should be getting a good raise this year.
It was not horrible under Obama.
"Fuck you Obama you warcriminal, racebating, thief."
Not one thing have come out of you begin president.
You are one of the worst president we have ever had.
Disgusting that the first black president was you.
RIP your mailbox OP.
Holy fuck
He still has 2 months.
Our great-grandchildren will know about this man.
Amazing legacy left behind sir.
"From an outsider's perspective, Obama to me was the best thing that could have happened to America, and possibly the world."
Thank you sir.
EDIT: a letter
Thanks Obama.
God bless us all.
"Thanks, Obama."
You'll be greatly missed as president.
:( Obama for life.
"No matter what he did or what he said, he stood for the right thing."
He's still our president until January 1st 2017.
Thanks Obama.
I'm glad you were my president.
He wasn't Great.
He wasn't the worst.
He was ok.
He did damage.
He did good.
He was a president.
"With what's about to come, people are really going to appreciate what Obama did for America."
"This election has demonstrated we didnt deserve him, and we will likely not get anybody close to him in the near future."
Probably the coolest Presidents ever.
I'll miss him
"I find it interesting how that whole ""thanks Obama"" thing started as blame, and how it turned from blame to sincerity."
It's amazing the change in view someone can have on a population with enough given time.
Trump being so close to becoming president is probably helping some as well.
TIL that a good President is a President you bearly notice.
"Thanks Obama, love Canada."
This had like 25k upvotes what happened
How did this go from 20K+ to 5K?
Is that legit?
Thanks Obama .
for what exactly?

Yeah thanks for nothing.
For nothing.
Good riddance.
I can't really complement on him politically but I've got to say that Obama is easily the most loveable politician I know of.
I'm not American but I would've been proud to have a president like Obama.
He did a great job after the catastrophic presidency of Bush.
He was a chocolate chip in a sea of milk and gave America hope during a bad time.

Proud of you all!
Blizzard is quickly reaching a Crossroad; Do they want the Western audience or the Chinese audience?
I can imagine the QA section at Blizzcon.
"HK protestor: “why is blizzard supporting the corrupt Chinese government”Blizzard: “uhhh, do you guys not have rights?"
Blitzchong.
what a fucking hero.
I bet he didn't think it would actually get this big.
It turned into an entirely different but very important subject of foreign independent enterprises doing the dirty work of authoritarian governments.
"That's something that we can not have moving forward into the future where, to be honest, China is in a prime position to be the dominant economic superpower."
Seriously fuck Blizzard.
"I've been having fun playing classic, but I just cancelled my subscription and in the 'tell us why' field I told them it was because of Hong Kong."

Good for them.
A software  company boot licking the number one software pirating country is as dumb as supporting their tyranny.
"It's absolutely amazing how Blizzard *itself* blew this whole thing up, with how they handled one minute on some stream that the vast majority of people would never have known of."
"They could've simply said: ""hey, this is against the rules, whether we agree or disagree with your message we need to enforce the rules or people will do whatever they want."

"* It probably would not have even registered in other ActiBlizz communities, let alone been a thing to people completely outside of gaming."
"Yet - thanks to their intense, burning desire to suck up to the CCP now EVERYONE knows about it."
"Even more people are now aware of all the vile shit China does, thanks to people linking stories about China's human right abuses under every Blizzard/China post on all the social media."
And it's now very obvious that Blizzard is full of shit when they claim to support human rights (as they did with LGBT stuff).
They don't.
"They like to say they do when it costs them nothing, but they don't."
"Well done, Blizzard."
You failed to protect your chinese overlords and you failed to protect your image.

Barbara Streisand got nothing on Blizzard.
"Guys Blizzard fucked up REAL bad,  but don’t forget other US entities like the NBA that bow down to these totalitarian pieces of shit."
Blizzard and every single company that follows suit needs to be brought to light.
"Blizzard deserves every single drop of shit they get for this, but it doesn’t stop with them."
"Last night in PHILADELPHIA (Wells Fargo Center) the NBA removed a protestor holding a Hong Kong support sign at a preseason game, here in AMERICA."
*Edit: It’s been pointed out to me that the fan was being unruly and that political signs are more or less always prohibited at sporting events.
"Whatever the case may be in Philadelphia (do your own research and decide), it does not change the fact that China’s influences are here."
Hollywood has been afraid to show the Chinese in a bad light for years.
Apple pulling the Taiwan flag emoji.
Shit like this is everywhere and it’s becoming more and more common.
South Park really wasn’t joking last week.
*Outrage should be the starting point and it should escalate from there.
This is unprecedented and inexcusable.
Major props to those who walked out.
I hope another company offers them some jobs.
I cancelled my WoW sub and uninstalled all their games from my PC for the first time in like 15 years.
"Fuck them, their games are becoming trash anyways"
It sickens me that an American company would hurt a person because they had a pro freedom approach to a political idea.
Our country is backwards as fuck right now.
It’s a legit embarrassment.

Every Twitch Streamer and Watcher should do the same.
Walk Out!
There is a MUCH larger discussion than video games and Hong Kong to be had here.
China is threat to the world.
They are playing the long game.
They are thinking generations.
"And now that they have economic clout combined with a significant military, they are incrementally creeping out."
They are making islands in the pacific out of atolls and militarizing them.
They are claiming islands that belong to other nations.
They are diplomatically isolating Taiwan from the rest of the world.
They are doing the whole Silk Road 2 project.
They established their first overseas military base in Africa recently.
They are playing a generational game.
"One where China slowly absorbs the world, either by might or dollar."
That is their plan anyway.
Forcing the world to comply with their political beliefs in our media is a step - watch South Park (the last episode) - they lay it out.
We have to keep calling this out all the time.
Corporations should be forced to make a stand.
You are either for freedom or for the dollar.
"Of course, the cynic in me says no one (or not nearly enough) will change their behavior to force corporations to change theirs."
EDIT: Thanks for the silver!
EDIT 2: Gold - thank you!
This is somehow worse PR than “sense of pride and accomplishment “.
"EA: Sure we may have the most downvoted post on reddit ever, but at least we didn't side with the fucking Chinese Government."
"While I'm glad they're doing this, walkouts are usually just ""they took a long lunch break today""."
"Do this daily, start hiding pro HK stuff in the code/art, or just stop working all together."
Make blizzard choose between the West or China.
Be Blizzard.
Employ employees mostly within the US.
"Do something that goes directly against American ideal (in theory, not always practice)."
Employees are mad.
*Pikachu face*
It's funny how people are trying to appeal to neutrality and argue 'not being political'.
"Well, Chizzard made this political by siding with China."
Big fan of Diablo.
Now Blizzard can suck my tiny little baby penis I ain't buying shit from them ever again
Once again.
Thank god bungie split.
Blizzard could have avoided all if this by not making a blatant decision to stand with China.
The world is watching what's going on in Hong Kong.
"why the fuck would you take such drastic measures while having the slogan ""Every Voice Matters"" at your headquarters."
That's clearly not the case.
I applaud the Blizzard employees for standing behind Blitzchung and his overblown punishment
This is like the corporate equivalent to sucking dick for money.
Except it's even less dignified because you're actually pretty well off already.
Blizzcon will be real interesting this year.
Oh boy.
I sold my stock on Robinhood when the news first broke.
It might be small and irrelevant but I'd rather take the loss and keep myself from supporting the company.
Blizzard ain't got no tegridy.
Not a gamer but I’m very interested in this story and incredibly impressed with how the community is aggressively seeking justice for this egregious wrong.
> The Chinese tech giant Tencent owns a 5% stake in BlizzardHow much of a stake do they own in Reddit again?
"I’ve played wow on and off since vanilla, love the game."
Was super pumped for classic and got to level 39.
Cancelled my sub yesterday.
I will resub if they admit their failure to support Democratic values and have a plan to right the wrong.
I’m not holding my breath.
"Funny how Blizzard's actions brought even more attention to the Hong Kong ordeal and also, with the utmost transparency, showed the world how greedy and heartless a group of board directors can be."
Capitalism at its finest /$
Please let all this shit be the kick in the ass some small upstart needs to make another actual good MMO.
"Big difference is north America actually cares about optics, where as China audience just wants mobile games."
Bye blizzard.
You made some seriously shit desicions under new management.
Do you guys not have phones?
#GamersRiseUp but actually  for serious and not a meme trololo fest and  proud humanity moment edition
America's capitalism is selling its freedom.
Cancelled my WoW subscription.
Enough is enough.
"Now that's what we call a ""pro gamer move"""
Blizzcon this year is going to be interesting
I hope this kills BlizzardFree expression is a VERY important human right
I just downloaded starcraft after not playing for five years but I guess I’m deleting it again
Why aren't news sites referring to this as Activision Blizzard instead of just Blizzard?

It's fantastic that many airlines teach flight attendants to look for the signs of human trafficking.
I hope she got rewarded for her quick thinking.
Good for her.
I can only hope that if I'm ever in a situation like this I'll be aware enough to see the signs and act.
"Human trafficking is a terrible and depressing thing, but it's really inspiring to hear about the people fighting it."
"This woman, along with the police involved in the California bust, deserves the recognition."

You know what I wouldn't want if I'd saved someone from traffickers?
My name and photo all over the internet.
I don't really care in which year this happened.
"I am just thankful the flight attendant was not only paying attention, but acted on her suspicions."
Wonderful to see at any time!
It's odd to me that I can't find any article online regarding the underlying arrest and/or trial of the man allegedly arrested for trafficking the girl from this story.
Cop here.
"Sex trafficking and humam trafficking seem like foreign, archaic, or extremely rare concepts to most people."
"I work for a medium sized agency, and we are finding victims on a monthly, if not weekly basis."
azcentral.
This is what happens to so many girls that run away from home.
I was personally involved in an investigation of a 14 year old girl who was talking to a male on her school lap top.
"Luckily that lap top had language filters on it, and the Vice Principal alerted us as the suspect was on his way to pick her up from school!"
This is also why we still investigate prostitition.
We arent looking to ticket prostitutes.
We are looking to help sex trafficking victims with no way out.
"EDIT - Parents, monitor your children's communications."
It could save their life.
What if someone else read the note.
"No one will see this, but this happened in 2011."
The girl is in college now.
wtsp.
I wonder how she got the note written and in the bathroom before the girl walked in?
THIS is amazing.
"This is what I wish we, as human beings, should focus on."
"Stop spending money trying to defeat drugs, and use that money to go after human traffickers."
"In my opinion, this should be our #1 focus, and where MOST of our money is spent."
God bless this woman.
My cousin works at Walmart and one day a girl handed her a note that said she had been kidnapped.
My cousin discreetly notified authorities and they saved the girl.
google.
OK so this is just an FYI IDK who this could help but~~~I remember reading about human trafficking and ways to prevent it and get out of these situations.
"They said a new technique they're telling girls (like child brides) is when they're at airports and going through customs and such, **hide a spoon or some kind of  paraphernalia in or on yourself."
That way your abductor can't see it and you get taken out of line by a metal detector.
"** This gives you an excuse to talk to authorities and hopefully, get free."
[deleted]
I'm curious how she left a note knowing when the girl would be using the bathroom
"She was 14-15, and is in college now, meaning this happened 3-4 years ago."
"I work in a hotel and we just took a course in human trafficking, its sad this part of our daily life."
I am on the lookout and so is 100% of our staff.
What an amazing woman.
I feel like she's purposely showing off her wedding ring because she knows I was getting ready to ask her out on a date.
Message received ma'am.
Message received
"For people who don't get it, this story came out a acouple of days before this Superbowl because sex trafficking spikes during large sporting events."
I'm not sure why OP decided to just post a picture and so little context.
I wonder if he was just stupid or does this happen often given he took a fucking plane.
And by this I mean human trafficking in the broad open.
"Hey guys, are there any great charities that fight human trafficking that we should start contributing to?"
Can we make human trafficking punishable by death?
"I mean, is everyone cool with that?"
[deleted]
I looked pretty hard and there is no followup with the guys name and if he was convicted.
"Nothing about his name anywhere, if this is human trafficking then why are they protecting the person?"
Human Traffickers hate her!
Wheres the rest of the story?
Did the man go to jail?
"Was he a US citizen, where were they going?"
How was the girl abducted?
Where was she abducted from?
So little details.
the article headline had as much info as the actual article did.
Reddit is becoming the next Facebook.
This shit was all over my Facebook this morning and SOMEONE HAS to post it here to get karma.
Typical internet shit.
Shitty jpeg of a person with a backstory as the title.
"I know I'm late to the game, but I thought it was such a wonderful story."
This woman is a hero.
"The event happened years ago, but is highlighted again because of the increase in effort for flight attendants to identify human trafficking."
An interesting side note is the difference in reporting.
"To confirm the story, I googled and looked at multiple sources."
This is an example on why it is so important to look at different sources for all your news.

I live on the other side of the world so I feel like I can’t do anything to help.
Is there any things I can do to show support for Hong Kong?
I am from China but I hate the Chinese Government
There is an abnormal amount of civil unrest in the world RN.
"^((note: by ""unrest"" I am not differentiation between good and bad."
The spirit and strength they have to come out against corruption is something we can ALL learn from.
Rooting for you guys!
This will be in a textbook one day
Hey Xi Jingping.
"uh, I think they are trying to tell you something bro."
"Fuck you, China."
"To be fair, I'm on record telling my own government to fuck off."
"Of course no coverage anywhere, same with Russian protests."
corporate news is a plague and needs to be banished.
"I’m impressed with how massive this protest movement is, how well organized and persistent it is."
How did they do it?
We could never have this in US.
Will this protest actually lead to anything?
China seem to not give a fuck
"It’s gotta be an awkward day for China’s Tencent, which owns a portion of Reddit."
What can I do as an American to help?
SERENITY NOW SERENITY NOW
China got fucked by Britain and Britain got HK.
[deleted]
My username is relevant but I'm not sure what to comment
Absolutely nobody I speak to in my family knows about this because they only watch local news in America and they act like I’m making it up when I try to explain the magnitude of this protest.
They also don’t know about Kashmir or the Myanmar genocides or the Russian protests 🤦‍♀️
"""Lol nope""  -  China"
I wish I lived in a city/state where the people cared this much about our futures.
Love you HK
"Full support the protesters, but this unfortunately is a Tiananmen Square massacre in the making."
Good luck with that.
I'm sure the Chinese Premier would love to have an island of democracy mucking up his communist perfection.
And to r/teenagers
"They assured me I was guilty but I commited no crime  They said confessions bring lenience so they put me on the line  So I protest the massacres at the Tiananmen Square  My friends said yo, stay away man, you better not go fucking back there    They wouldn't let me write about my opinions about the state  And freedom of expression they would never tolerate  And the military secrets that I never did steal  I didn't start no violence, and there was nobody that I killed    So I have a clear account of all the abuses of power  And the memories of my homeland have now gone sour  And I only got one weapon, its so plain for me to see  My only weapon I call."
"poetry    And I don't even know why  The truth seems like a lie  In my cell there is no sky  When I was arrested in Shanghai    Into wealth and priveledge, huh, I was not born  But a devotion to freedom and liberty, I was sworn  So every emotion is studdied, watched and controlled   Who gets paid, who gets disciplined, who gets rolled    A transmitter beams my coordinates anywhere on earth  And radio waves, surveilance, satellite burst  Open up your skull and let some knowledge come in  Crack open the cranium and let awareness begin."
once you get a taste at freedom.
Brave people you have my full respect and I wish you the best of luck

Power of people > People with power
They didn't write this just for their government they wrote this because they need the wests support let's not forget only a handful of countries even recognize Taiwan as an independent country for Hong long to be free we must help they fight the oppressors
"As a HKer living in Canada, I am so touched by what's happening in HK being recognized and heard worldwide."
I am also really sadden to see my home coming to this day.
I've been listening to some economic experts who have been saying that the only way China's socialist economy has been able to survive is due to Hong Kong and the other few capitalist areas it holds by force.
They were saying that socialist economic planners can't determine product values in shifting circumstances so they copy others.
Anyone else hear this or know more about it?
"If that's true, Hong Kong can never be free as long as the PRC is in power."
As a Hong Konger thank you.
From the Reddit I can only support you HK brave people with up vote but from here I can help to spread the message of a people that wish freedom.
I’m stuck in the Hong Kong airport with a bunch of panicked people.
I can wait a day here if it’ll help.
"Please, no need to thank my heroic actions!"
Why are all their signs in English and not Cantonese/Mandarin?
The fuck are these awards?
FUCK CHINA AND WINNIE THE XIN
Are we talking Democracy democracy or American Democracy because there is a clear difference.
What are the red squares?
My knee jerk reaction says that is part of the facial recognition system they have but I have no basis beyond knowing it exists.
"As a mainlander, I completely and sincerely support the people of HK."
"Eat shit, Pooh."
As a Brit I really wish our government would do more on this and offer help.
OMG how many thoughts and prayers will this take?
God speed HK.
"Fuck China, and Communism."
"Hong Kong, I support you."
"Portage, MI, USA."
Be safe.
be strong
"I think if we care about Hong Kong we should put pressure on our elected officials to put pressure on China, right?"
"But it would take a massive number and the West (US) barely cares about itself, let alone anyone else"
Hear the people
Such a strong image!
Keep on going people of HK
Chinese Government: This never happened
I am impressed by this courage.
Especially with regards to daily suppression in mainland China.
These protesters risk everything!
I wish China could be more democratic!
I know this is the wrong moment but why do the awards spell penis?
"Bump support, keep this in the frontpage folks!"
China is gonna kill all these people.
That’s what you get for living in a shitty country
Fucking chills man.
Take the power back.
After they get true democracy Antifa should move in and call all them racist Nazis and try to turn them all socialist.
They fight for democracy while the American looney left fight for oppression.
Backwards ass world we live in.
Nobody wants China’s bullshit.
I was in HK during the umbrella protests and was quite impressed.
Now the current protest reconfirms that HK society will keep its freedom whatever it takes.
Amazing
"This is on the one hand very inspiring, on the other hand I know a lot of the people in photos like this are going to be dead once China starts cracking down for real and that makes me sad."

Best of luck to them.
This situation seems like it's ready to boil over.
"democracy protests in hong kong, and in moscow."
signs of hope to weigh against the rise of nationalism in the west.
That looks bangin!
"We the UK should have never given the territory back to China, if anything Hong Kong should of been made an independent country instead of having their rights and freedoms stripped away day by day."
"It’s so sad to see that most of the news outlets and social media just seem to ignore this issue but only in Reddit, this fight for freedom gets recognised."
Pathetic.
"Honestly, fuck PRC at this point."
I wonder why it's in English

I got a letter one time asking me to please stop calling velcro “velcro.
"”  Sorry that your brand name has become a noun, but no way I’m calling it “interlocking fastening tape."
"”Edit: If you haven’t watched the video posted below by toolazytomake, do it."
"Not once, but over and over."
It’s awesome and would have gotten me to change my mind back in the day.
"And if you upvoted me, upvote the video."
So we're all just going to ignore this guy's eyes?
Really?
"I think I'm ovulating right now, and I'm a straight guy."
"whenever you send someone a cease and desist, you should expect them to immediately post said cease and desist publicly"
"Not many people know, but trademark holders are actually ***legally obligated*** to defend their trademarks, or else risk losing them."
Were you selling them though?
"If they were for personal use, send them a reply letter with a Crocs themed condom and tell them to fuck themselves."
As long as your not selling them I really don’t think they can do anything about it.
This crocs me up
That implies that they think croc gloves have a market.
I really hope they do not start making these .
Was the Cease and Desist from Crocs?
Or just the general public?
I want you to slap me in the face once while wearing those.
You have my full permission.
The hero we never knew we needed.
You Mickey blue eyes lookin mf.
those are beyond awful.
We have transcended fingerless gloves.
Now make the boot form: Doc Crocs
"This is exactly what I would expect the ""Croc gloves"" guy to look like"
"""He just gave our company free advertising!"
"""""Hmmm, send him a cease and desist just in case he's onto something."
I don’t know how they can enforce that C&D.
"You aren’t making volume, so there’s no patent to enforce."
"They aren’t commercially available, so there’s no mechanism from the FTC or DOC that you’re violating."
"You aren’t packaging them, so you aren’t infringing on trade dress."
Maybe you can’t call it Crocs publicly.
This is a typical strong arm lawyer tactic.
Get your attorney to tell them to pound sand.
I’ve lost respect for those A-holes.
"Your effort was clearly aimed at humor and novelty, not libel/slander or defamation."
You look exactly like someone who would be in this situation
God sent crocs a cease and desist but they ignored it
"Damn, and to think I could’ve worn those gloves with my jean shorts and jean jacket and not be judged at all."
[deleted]
I'm excited to see what you do next!
Yoooooo where my Ugg gloves at?
So can I buy a pair or not?
I’m not sure what this post is about.
Im lost in that guy’s eyes.
Stirring something in me.
"Years ago I had a printer (I think it was an Epson) that had an ""emergency print"" mode."
"If it was running low on any color, ""emergency print"" would do its best to print your document with whatever ink it had available."
"Even if all it had was yellow, by god it would print your document in yellow."
"If it had nothing by cyan and magenta and you wanted to print a photo of your cat, you'd get a funky posterized picture of your cat."
But it would still print it.
"God, I miss that printer."
And trying to cancel something that's already in the queue is almost as hard as trying to cancel Comcast
"""But you have cyan!"
"""No, fuck you!"
This is cheap cyan!
I want the OFFICIAL cyan!
Edit: yes I am talking about HP.
Fuck you HP.
That'll be $40.
Whole new printer?
Printers and the ink cartridges are the biggest scam that you can ever buy into.
"[""I'm out of ink!"
"Dat smile, tho."
PC Load Letter?
My HP won't print on 8.
5x11 if the 5x7 photo paper tray is empty.
Printers are like divas who refuse to perform unless everything is perfect.
"I once fixed a printer by painstakingly separating green M&M's from hundreds of packages, filling a bowl with just the green ones, and then smashing the bowl into the printer shouting ""GODDAMMIT YOU BITCH, JUST FUCKING WORK!"
"""  Sometimes you just need to show a printer who's boss."
"And back in the day you used to be able to tell it to just print anyway, and it was on you when the page came out tinted yellow, magenta or cyan instead of black."
You can't do that anymore with modern printers.
"Sucks when you *really* need that thing printed right now, but it doesn't have to be perfect."
it just has to exist and be semi-readable.
IT guy here.
This is exactly how printer error codes work.
"Just like humans number their jokes, printers number their insults."
I need cyan to make black!
You know because.
of reasons and yellow!
I need yellow and cyan otherwise this whole thing isn't going to work.
Fuck printers Mx922 print head costs as much as a new printer and it's a 5$ part to make.
My printer was working fine and I thought I would try the Google appstore Canon app .
it asked me if it was ok if it was ok to send usage info to Canon I had to click yes .
than immediately after it throws a b200 error codes at me.
I love your comics.
And you wasted all the cyan in the comic.
"IT Reseller here, Ink printers are a scam, that's why Printer mfr's sell printers below their cost."
"Most IT departments have a ""going green"" initiative, but that's really not stopped anyone from printing stuff they don't need to print esp in color."
"For home office users like myself, I use a monochrome HP LJ P1102W laser."
I bought a Brother all in one Printer/Scanner with ADF.
"It no longer has ink, I just use it for scanning, works great especially on 25 page documents."
"When I go out for client site visits and need info in color, I go to FedEx or UPS stores, or Staples, overall, still cheaper than buying color ink toner."
"Printer: “Bitch, did I stutter!"
"Hello, thank you for reading my comics, you can see more on my Instagram (@System32comics)"
That is why I switched over to laser printers.
And that’s when I decided to see if printers can fly.
"They can’t, but I’m ok."
I had a Canon printer/scanner combo once.
If you were out of ink the scanner would not function.
The scanner app would literally tell you the scanner can’t work because the printer is out of ink.
Dumbest shit ever.
You ever wonder why you need yellow when you print a black & white document?
Because your printer prints a yellow dot matrix of your printer model and serial number as well as the date and time of the document you printed.
wikipedia.
wikipedia.
org/wiki/Machine_Identification_Code) I fully expect this to be a top TIL post within a week.
"The blinking red light on the office printer, the bane of my working life."
"Also printer: ""THAT'LL BE $200 FOR A NEW INK DRUM PLEASE!"
So it's not just my Epson?
"Printers mix a little cyan into every printing no matter if its color or just black n white, it mainly does that so you have to go buy a new ink cartridge quicker than if it just used black ink."
"Print>Printer Properties>Check Print as grayscale>Sauce: I spent 2 years as the ""Printer guy"" at a hospital with 400 HP printers."
"Wasn't my job but, stupid me I made the mistake of telling my boss I was an IT in the Navy"
Then turn off rich black.
I have a printer/scanner that won't SCAN if it is out of any of its inks😒
Hey printer can you scan this Paper jam That fine I just want to- PAPER JAM
Black And white printer owners rise up!
Fuck I hate printers.
"I bought a new printer last year, worked like a charm for the whole year, it was basically a painless experience of plug and play."
"Almost 1 year on the dot, windows does not recognize the driver signature anymore, HP didn't renew them."
"HP tells me to install the new drivers, I do, doesn't work."
"HP tells me to plug it directly into my computer, so I am like dude, this is a network printer, you're gonna fix this shit while it's on wifi, not while it's plugged into my computer so that you can say that it now works and you hang up."
"Went through the whole routine and ""It appears you used the automatic firmware upgrade function on the printer, the latest drivers are not compatible with the latest firmware, only the older firmware."
"You'll need to install the older drivers while going into unsigned driver installation of windows, but we cannot provide support for this."
Our recommendation is that you buy the new model of printer!
Yeah fuck them
My mom’s color inkjet was very helpful.
"When you ran out of black ink, it would oh so helpfully create black ink by combining all the more expensive color cartridges ink."
So helpful.
I’m surprised we haven imagined the printer as a drug addict snorting toner.
PC load letter?
What the fuck does that mean?
"""Ok fine I'll print in black and white""*prints in green*"
Can I be awkward and ask for a non-sweary copy of this?
I have some friends and family members who would appreciate the joke but not the 'fuck'.
Printers gonna print.
[deleted]
The smile makes it all ok
This is why I invested in a laser printer for home use.
It’s a far better deal and results in quality printing.
The attached scanner is a plus.
"And, it's always when you have something urgent to print!"
I bought a brother color LaserJet 3 years ago and never looked back.
"Thing is a beast, and I'm still on the toner cartridges that it came with."
"The system allows you to reset the cartridge life on the screen, no fidly DRM or anything."
"Imagine every electronic device requiring like 5 charging ports, 4 of them are colors and one is electricity, and if one of them is low but you aren't going to use it but it still refuses to work, even though it has plenty left, and one charge of 4 colors costed 90 dollars, would you use that electronic?"
"“Sorry, out of toner “  That’s ok, I just want to scan a document to email."
Said.
Toner.
”  Fuck you xerox.
This is why I'm glad that I found a small b&w laser printer at Goodwill for $25.
Bought two third party toner cartridges for $33 on Amazon.
"This was 2 years ago, and it's still going strong on that first cartridge."
"Admittedly, I don't print often, but an inkjet would have dried up long before now."
Best Goodwill find ever.
Got a cheap Brother laser printer so I don't have to worry about ink drying out anymore.
Black and white laser printer is the true solution.
Fuck inkjet.
"I remember old printers where if you didn't have any black ink, you just changed the font to blue and the printer did the best it could using just CMY."
black and white laser printer master race!
I haven't replaced the toner since I bought the thing over 5 years ago
LPT- set your printer to greyscale and it will bypass the warning and only prints in black and white.
I want to scan this documentI need ink for that
*puts in cyan“Ok now print!
”“OUT OF MAGENTA”
"Ink recharge are 1,20$ to make for manufacturer."
Sold between 30 and 50$ in supermarket.
"I bought one bottle of black ink and syringe to refill for 10$, already refilled the recharge 3 times and the bottle is only half empty."
Don't be a sheep.
I felt this comic in my bones.
I've been in IT for 35 years.
Printers have always sucked.
They will always suck.
This is actually the FBI's fault.
I need 15 karma points
And you want to download the driver?
"Great, google the model number."
Go to the manufacturers product page.
Click “Support and Drivers”.
"Enter model number, because there’s no direct link to drivers on the product page, you have to search for them again."
"Then choose which of the five driver packages you actually want to download, No, you don’t want to use the Canon Download Assistant, zip is fine."
Driver package is still over 100 mb for some reason.
"Anytime someone says, ""I need to print X."
""" My first question is always, ""why?"
My housemates and I share a color printer + scanner combo from Epson.
You'd think it could scan without ink.
it cannot.
"Its funny because Microsoft's default ""black"" is actually about a 60% mix of Magenta, Cyan and Yellow and only a 20% mix of black inks."
"It's so you get a nice crisp, dark ink that won't look washed out over time."
It's all a ploy.
"ALWAYS check off ""Print in Greyscale"" if you're printing what you assume is black and white."
Epson
I purchased a black only printer that last forever for this reason.
Don't need color anyways 99% of the time.
Months ago I tried to print out a BLACK AND WHITE document with the BLACK AND WHITE printer option.
"It said it was low on cyan, but still printed it out."
The thing turned out fucking ORANGE WHAT THE FUCK
lol wow what an original joke

This is literally the most heroic thing I have ever seen

Dad of the decade.
Roll Level: Dark Souls III
I like how everyone assumes what this man did was natural.
Obviously *not*.
This man called upon the spirits of 13 generations of dads and they all possessed him at the same time to pull the shit you see on screen off.
"I'm sad to say this man will never repeat this stunt, but at least he now has the wisdom of dads past."
[deleted]
Notify the Olympic committee because this guy deserves a gold medal.
Give that man something nice.
Total life saver and probably not the kids' father.
That tuck and roll.
crucial.
"When the kids turn into teens and start acting up, dad needs only to show them this gif and say ""Stop it."
"Damn, while the other two guys ran away, this guy ran TOWARD danger."
He was holding something in his hand and he still got BOTH of them.
That dude is a real life super hero.
I swear it's like all dads are average joes then there kids are in danger and fucking Clark Kent is exposed
"I think the little one got knocked out, but that's a fair trade for what was about to happen."
Dude this is the top number 1 dad reflex I have ever seen.
Most dad reflexes are like oh you saved  baby from a bump on the noggin.
This one was you literally saved your childrens lives.
Those kids would be dead if not for their father
I'm surprised he could do that back flip with balls that big.
that´s one of those moments where you realize what kind of person you are deep down.
Would say he passed.
This is the most heroic shit I've ever seen.
I want an autograph!
Looks to me like someone just blew his cover
Not sure they're even his.
Looks like he was just a bystander who reacted.
"Either way, that was ninja and he's a fucking hero."
Good man.
"They say you are what you eat, he must have just had a lifesaver"
That backwards roll!
Holy shit.
I don't know how he did that with two kids in his arms!
"Everything in his body must have been saying this isn't going to work, but this is the only path left to me."
"For a very sad individual, this warmed me this morning."
Thanks.
People are awesome.
"I think his first instinct there was flight, but his dad reflexes took over"
Everyone is talking how they can't stop watching but this makes me so fucking angry at that driver
Did you see the 2 seconds of oh crap?
It's that little 2 step thing.
I think he had to fight real hard against that flight reflex.
Good thing he fully committed to his actions after that.
Any slower and he and kids would have been smashed.
That dude's my hero
This is honestly one of the most incredible things I've ever seen.
Is there a source for this/any additional info?
Is that a snake that's writhing on the floor?
That guys dodge roll even protected the kids from hitting the ground!
Truly a hero.
Absolutely incredible.
"While I hope to never be in this situation, I hope I can have that amount of bravery if ever faced with it."
Can we find out who this guy is?
I would give him 12 bucks because that was better than any action movie I've ever seen.
This guy needs a medal and his face on a cereal box
The backward roll that made the difference in clearing the wheels of the car.
Fucking dead set Jackie Chan level legend.
They really need to make rolling cost more stamina.
r/DadReflexes
That's the reaction that people day dream about.
This dude is a straight up superhero!
Motherfucker just no handed backflip-saved 2 kids from death.
What've you done recently?
automatic entry into heaven
*My* life flashed before my eyes.
That was intense!
He just unlocked Dad-God mode.
His Dad jokes may be lethal from this point on.
"What a fucking badass, walks into oncoming car, grabs kids, and does a backward roll."
12/10 dad.
Does he proceed to beat the driver to death?
Point A - ZOOMIES - Point B
"*I added a step, see if you can notice the difference*"
Well …he did sit.
"Aw man, this needs sound."
Don't know how the owner managed not to laugh during the zoomies.
*The Ministry of Silly Walks approves*
*I DID GOOD I DID GOOD I DID SO GOOD I WAITED AND SAT UNTIL YOU CALLED ME AND THEN I CAME TO YOU I DID SO.
*Sees her face*Oh.
I forgot the last part.
Nothing wrong with a little personal flair.
He did it way better than alllll the other pups.
Full marks!
Typical boxer 😍 my girl is like bambi in a field lol
Nailed it.
I used to compete in Schutzhund nationally and help train people to train their dogs.
Whoever taught her how to train her dog did an excellent job.
"None of it is forced, the dog is willingly complying."
"I'm not sure if this is a mock trial, some other obedience event, or an official Schutzhund B event, but further stages are age-restricted as the dogs mature."
This would not be allowed in later trials but it shows that the dog has an eagerness to please and obey and that she is keeping training fun.
Brilliant.
That's my kinda dog.
Personality 100%
Those is just boxer tings
Yeah but to be fair no one said it couldn’t do it with FLAIR!
And Pizzazz!
This is how I walk everywhere.
I see no problem here.
10/10
What are they training for?
17/10 for style!
"Human: ""Step1 stay."
Step2 run.
Step43 sit.
"""Dog: ""What about steps 3-42""Human: ""Improvise"""
"He did a good job, 10/10 good boy"
"*Any asshole dog can run up and sit, but can they do ""THIS"" Karen?"
**50 points to Gryffindor**
"Boxers, essentially cocaine in Dog form."
Boxer?
Boxer.
It's a boxer.
Its operating as expected.
He thought it was a dance recital and had some new moves to show off.
My husband has been wanting a boxer for years and I've been saying no.
This changed my mind.
I need this kind of derp in my life 🤣
Sometimes enthusiasm gets control and I have to dance !
Very typical boxer move.
Straight savage.
+ 10 points for style.
Can we get one with sound please?
r/maliciouscompliance
And THIS is why I love boxers!
"This doggo is the embodiment of the breed; they are the spazziest, lovable and loyal dog you will ever have!"
I have had 2 in my life.
I lost my girl Izzy last year - she was my bff for 12 great years!
I miss her dearly.
But I don't have the heart to have another - I will see her in heaven because that is where she is.
Boxers are the funniest people.
Video with sound on youtube.
Not sure if this was linked or not.
We have a winner.
Instruction unclear; become tornado?

I would be so proud if that was my doggo
Boxers are the greatest
What a great job from a great doggo
Excellent style!
Some dogs sit.
Some sit with pizzazz.
"He is the goodest boy in the contest, I'm sure"
Extra points for style?
No one said what the dog could or could not do during the run.
"Well, he’s a boxer, soooo."
Tries to squeeze in some quick zoomies hoping noone would notice
"if the task is to simply *run up and sit*, how else would you differentiate yourself from the competition?"
That was the most boxer response I've ever seen when under pressure to just be a random ole dog.
Bravo.
Entertaining and obedient.
what a good boi
Would those be slammy whammies or zoomies?
"Or the hitherto unlabeled category, zoomy whammies?"
Boxers are high energy with goofy personalities.
"I his defense, he did all that."
He just couldn't help throwing in a few whirly zooms on top of it.
I give him 10/10 for originality.
He tried running so fast that he looked like a giraffe on the startup.
Perfect execution!
Best In Show right there.
Everyone else can go home.
"I feel kinda sorry for the lady, but the damn goofball is having a blast."
"Owner: ""Come""Doggo: ""RODEOOOOO!"
10/10
Dedication 9000
you left me there for a FULL HOUR!
I'm so glad to be with you again.
Nailed it.
And he did exactly that.
Perfect score.
I love boxers.
Boxers are the goofiest dogs
Seems about right for a boxer.
Flawless.
That's a ~~Tigger~~ *Boxer*You're lucky it didn't bounce up expecting her to catch it for love and snuggles.
The fact it only spun around a few times and then actually sat is a damn miracle.
He put his own spin on it.
When you're a boxer and all those years of pent up urge to chase your tail despite having none finally become too much.
His head couldn't keep up with that launch.
It was like a cartoon.
When I was taking a dog training class at one point we had to stand at the other side of the room from our pup and tell him to come.
"Some of the dogs ignored the command or wandered off, others actually made it across the room to their proud owners."
"My dog however bolted towards me at top speed; initially I was impressed he understood enough to head in my direction, especially with so many potential distractions along the way."
"As I'm standing there smiling, expecting to be one of the few that successfully completed the activity, my dog reaches me (he still hasn't slowed down at this point), and bolts right past and out the open door that was behind me."
It only led into a stairwell but it cracked all of us up.
"I have no idea what he expected to find in there, but it's definitely one of my favourite moments from his training."
It's like his head wasn't ready for all that acceleration.
"I mean, it *is* a boxer, so that was actually very restrained."
You can practice everyday for months and take your dog to all the classes and this stuff still happens.
"Dog shows even host ""fun matches"" that are basically like practice shows for puppies to get experience and for people to practice obedience and agility in this type of setting, but when it comes down to it, dogs are gonna dog."
"I went to my first obedience trial when I was probably 10 or 11 and saw a Bernese Mountain dog take off from his owner, jump out of his ring and into another ring because he saw another Bernese Mountain dog."
He literally just wanted to visit.
My Boxer has a nice control of her zoomies but when she has them holy crap.
"She's either jumping over something a car, couch, or a small child."
Or she's pretending to be a greyhound mixed with a cheetah.
Good boy!
Think the dog gave himself whiplash.
this should be on the never celebrate too early compilations
Pure excitement
Doggy jazz hands
"Im dead, that did the thing."
It stopped me from breathing.
“Miscalculated zoomies amount”
All I see here is extra credit
The dog equivalent of doing a donut into a parallel parking spot.
He just added some sweet ass style
I own a boxer.
This is the best trained boxer ever.
Had a boxer for years and she was the exact same way.
Nailed it!
I expected no less from a boxer :>
That is exactly what that dog did.
She ran up and sat.
She just did it in the most Boxer way possible.
Boxer being very boxer like.
I swear those dogs' energy levels could power a city.
"OMG, this is making me so excited to get my boxer pup in November."
"If any of you watch this and say ""I need a dog like this in my life"" Literally find any Boxer and adopt it, they are all spinny spazzes who turn into donuts when excited."
About as regal as can be expected by a boxer.
This is the most Boxer thing I’ve ever seen!
My baby does stuff like this all the time 😭
This is why boxers are the best dogs.
They will listen and execute perfectly.
only if they want to though.
"Ah, boxers."
The nuts of the dog world.
Nailed it
r/technicallycorrect
God I love boxers.
Mine is 11 and still plays with my other dogs like she is a puppy.
Definitely not as agile as she once was and it's tough knowing she won't be here one day.
He did it perfect!
Jsut a bit of th ol' razzle dazzle first.
I could tell that was a boxer without even seeing its face.
This is the epitome of a boxer
This is why I love boxers.
"So the doggie cyclone was great, but it's important not to miss when the dog's body took off so hard, it's head couldn't keep up and he gave himself whiplash"
"The juxtaposition of the referee's slow walk into her position to deeply analyze this dog, versus him simply not giving a single flying fuck about anything except becoming the world's best dog helicopter."
it's too much.
"The dog did sit, and he made sure to throw in a little extra flair for bonus points!"
"Pure Boxer, what did you expect?"
Flawless
Boxers gonna boxer!
I think they do this just because they like feeling the single marble in their heads swirl around.
"He did dun up and sit in front of her,  he just did it with a little more PIZAZZ than expected"
I DID IT I DID IT I DID IT!
- dog probably
so my boxer is fine .

"Added in camel spins for increased difficulty, 10/10"

Fucking boxers man.
Love em but dumb as hell
Extra style points
I think that’s a boxer.
"I don’t have much experience with them, but this seems about right, assuming it is a boxer."
Nailed it!
Give them the ol' razzle dazzle
Bonus point for the fancy dance moves
Soooo.
"bonus points for style, right?"
Is it a boxer?
It strikes me as a boxer thing to do
Peak Boxer!
"360 No Sit, fuckin nailed it"
Didn’t know dogs came with a spin cycle!
Boxer in a nutshell.
"I love the acceleration, head thrown back, white of the eyes seen, one paw almost galloping in the air."
11/10.
great performance.
you win the competition.
as far as i can tell this Boxer was set to pause and then fast forward.
"Love boxer dogs, thanks for sharing!"
#NAILED IT
Boxers man.
"I have a boxer too, they are all a bit crazy!"
"You read the title, see the dog is a Boxer."
"Yep, this isn't going to go exactly to plan."
Of course it had to be a boxer.
"Having done obedience, I would have loved to hear what the judge said to the owner at the end."
"After judging robot obedience dogs all day, I am sure she enjoyed this dog's sheer joy on that recall."
What a wonderful dog!
100/10
Can you give us a link with sound .
"the *sauce*, if you will?"
"After all, I want to hear everybody bursting in laughter!"
I love the boxer spins!
Boxers are special.
That was the most Boxer dance I have ever seen.
"He did with style, now I’m impressed."
"As someone who owns a boxer, this cannot be any more accurate if it tried to be!"
Have to love Boxers.
From cool and calm to berserk in .
5 seconds.
I love Boxers!
Perfect execution of a very complex routine.
I award the gold medal.
This reminds me of when someone sings the national anthem at the Superbowl and decides to do a long drawn out OOOO Ahhh OOOOOO mmmmm hmmmmmm rendition at the end.
"Technically he did everything correct, but with some bonus moves added."
I been having a kind of shitty day so this made me laugh
He just added a little razzle dazzle.
Jiu jitsu!
Parkour!
I love you!
Thats a boxer 100%
"That my friends, is the boxer summed up in a 10 second video."
Best breed ever.
The way his head tilts backwards when he starts is killing me.
Cue the cartoon sounds !
now someone copy and paste so it looks like hundreds of guy narutos
Holy shit.
I can't believe this slow motion cam actually caught him.
Could you imagine being the person in Japan who created Naruto (Masashi Kishimoto) and seeing that this is the culmination of your life's work.
"Holy shit, people actually went out there?"
"Without the cloud cover of accompanying vapelords flanking him, his naruto run will be easily detectable and his efforts in vain."

"As dorky as the Naruto run is in practice, he nails it."
It's as if he trained for this moment his entire life.
"Believe it or not ladies, he's single."

"That settles it then, theres no way the military can deal with the naruto run."
Those who are running please don’t forget to take pictures of the UFOs and share in reddit.
I can't stop watching this.
This is hilarious.

"If I traveled that far to see the shitshow, I would absolutely naruto run across the background of literally every camera I saw for the laughs"
you think this will be in our childrens' childrens' history books?
How did they catch him on film?
This whole stupid thing was worth it just for this clip.
LEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOYYYY
I just had to explain naruto running to my coworker because of this.
and I sounded as stupid as it looked.
I have a guy live streaming it tomorrow on his FB.
I was in class when I saw this I snorted my water and am now a laughing stock still worth it tho
Every now and again the human race produces some amazing content.
This might be the biggest autism awareness festival in history
"I am too old I guess, why is he running like he is in an anime cartoon?"
"That guy can drop dead right now, he will never reach this level of epic for the rest of his life 😂"
I wondered why there is virtually no news about it in the UK.
Do they have any news in the US.
How many people turned up?
Hope no one gets hurt or does anything stupid.
"Honestly, I'm sort of jealous of the people that showed up."
I wished I was that enthused about a topic to take off from work and show up for a meme.
Slight off topic.
"I tried to naruto run once, it's very difficult especially when you get some speed."
It just throws off your center of gravity and you become very unstable.
This mini moment where the other news anchors are flickering on the screen is making me more nervous than the naruto running and imminent battle of ALIENSTOCK.
Looks more like Sonic to me
"Vaper crew is just a distraction, they exhale their clouds filled with chakra and are unable to be seen."
"There have been a lot of rumors about Chinese censorship flying around recently, with quite a few people insisting that the moderators have been paid off to suppress this sort of content."
That's obviously absurd.
but now those same individuals have taken to harassing anyone who so much as asks for more information about the protests in Hong Kong.
(Apparently asking questions is the same thing as promoting censorship now.
")The current political climate is already incredibly volatile, and there's no need to throw abuse or spurious claims around."
"As such, while we welcome all discussion about these events, **harassment, vitriol, and calls to violence will not be tolerated**."
"As a reminder, we only pull content that violates the sub's rules or site-wide policies."
"Our thoughts are with the victims of this ongoing atrocity, and we sincerely wish them all the best."
"""That could be any city!"
"""HK officials"
Do they not know wtf the internet is?
Society is recording everything
I have got to hand it to these protesters.
They are ballsy AF and show great ingenuity.
Respect for those protesters who don’t run from the tear gas but douse it quickly to prevent it from spreading.
‘Illusion’ my arse.
"**Quoting The New York Times:**>**It’s ""hugely problematic"" that Hong Kong police fired tear gas from above crowds**, an expert said, as seen here."
"**“If it hits someone in the head, you could kill them,""** said Jim Bueermann, former president of the Police Foundation in Washington."
“I have never seen that before.
**Tear gas is meant to be used at the edge of crowds and below knee-level**.
But we found cases where Hong Kong police did just that.
"In this video, police appear to fire tear gas at protesters after they retreated to a subway station."

May I say **多謝 Thank you** on behalf of the millions of Hong Kongers longing for justice and democracy.
Timezones are an amazing thing.
It's 2019 everywhere else but it's just ticked over to 2047 in Hong Kong.
“ Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
I’m starting to think those Hong Kong police are a bunch of assholes.

"Man, fuck Chinese government."
"Crazy to do this stuff to anyone, let alone your own people."
"I know China cares about their image to the world and doesn't want to completely fuck it up, but they're heading that way."
I've reached the point where I'm considering not buying Chinese goods anymore.
Just because it's the only thing I can do to show my feelings to them from here
Just like beating a detainee old man in a hospital was “illusion of camera” and the Chinese economy imploding is “illusion of camera”.
"Are protestors running towards the canisters, to throw them away from the crowd?"
"If so, heroes."
"Death from above, China doesn't give a shit about their own people."
Hong Kong citizens are an example to the world right now.
Those look like they can still injure someone with a hardhat onEdit; Can those umbrellas actually deflect the canisters or do they simply slow it down?
"Oh, you mean they are fucking liars?"
Why the fuck can no one say the word LIE anymore?
They are liars who keep fucking lieing about everything.
"There, it's easy"
That looks extremely dangerous.
The Chinese doing something illegal?
Saving this for when Reddit's Chinese overlords demand it be removed.
How do they dispose of the canisters?
Can they drown them?
FUCK THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
China is asshole
"Do people at these events ever bring something, like a large bowl, to cover tear gas canisters and prevent the gas from diffusing."

Look at how quickly they are snuffing those canisters.
That’s serious organization and dedication.
Do HK police and people in power not realize the entire world is aware of the situation and that we are seeing all of this?
How do they deny any of this?
I’m genuinely confused by the stupidity of these people denying something then it shows up on the internet 30 minutes later.
Disgusting.
I have zero respect remaining for the Hong Kong police force.
A bunch of cowards the lot of them.

I am curious.
Conservatives who believe we should have guns to fight back against our government.
Do you think the people of Hong Kong should pick up arms?
If so what do you think the outcome will be?
What worries me most is history repeating itself.
At what point will the Hong Kong police stop?
"So while I get they are literally beating the shit out of these protesters, so they obviously don't care about safety and all."
But launching those canisters from that high up looks like it would hurt like hell taking one of those off the dome.
"These ""police officers"" look like a bunch of assholes."
"Even if the government shuts these protests down, they're never going to be able to live this down."
Even if it doesn't go full on tiananmen square massacre.
The people of Hong Kong need to turn up the heat.
Are let these somewhat volatile?
"Also, hitting someone directly from that distance could cause some serious damage."
FUCK YOU CHINA
These protests will go down in history for sure.
These are strong resilient people against cruel lawless police.
That's some Siege of Shanghai shit right there.

"For those in the Boston and surrounding areas, there will be a discussion about the lack of human rights in China on September 11th."
The forum will be held in the Cambridge area and there will be a number of us showing up to support the protestors in Hong Kong.
Why is anyone reporting this like it's a *shock horror*?
"It's the Chinese, do we really expect them to do anything less than what they are doing?"
"While I find it deplorable what they are doing to the HK'ers, it's only a matter of time before something 'happens' and they start shooting protestors."
"Edit: Chinese government, not the Chinese."

"Once again, I'd like to echo another thread's comments."
"Cynicism is an inevitable thing, but it might do more harm than good:There are a disturbing number of posts here that are attempting to completely normalize the idea that 1) China taking HK early is inevitable, and 2) that there is nothing anyone can or will do about it."
"Either Reddit has become filled with sociopathic armchair assholes (racing to predict a horrible outcome), or some people really want to push a particular narrative and sow the seeds of defeatism for the benefit of a particular government."
"Seriously, what is the value in pushing that narrative?"
It's like going to a playground and yelling to children how their future is scorched Earth due to climate change because it is inevitable and no one cares.
Are you right?
Maybe.
Should you share that position so brazenly and thoughtlessly?
Fuck no.
"The future of a few million people are potentially about to change drastically, for the worse, and here we have a room full of pricks jockeying for the rights to call themselves prognosticators."
"You erode people's sense of hope, will to fight oppression, and prime them to ignore the suffering of others, all so you can sit their smugly and say ""I told you so."
"""Meanwhile, you are wrong."
"It may be very likely, but it is not inevitable."
"Speaking up against China will be costly, but not impossible or ineffective."
"The people of HK and China do care and notice who in the world has HKs back, and who in the world is readying to look the other way."
There is a sickening element here readying others to look the other way.
"Kinda reminiscent of bots from Russia, no?"
Certainly China wouldn't do anything like that.
What can we do to help
Hong Kongers rise up.
Considering the large mobilizations of the military into the area I would speculate that they will be shooting more than just an eye very soon.
Sending the best wishes to these people but it doesn't look like it will end well for them.
I support Hong Kong.

"Pepe, btw, wasn’t created to spread hate, only adopted by the hateful."
"Please stand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom with us."
"We, the Hongkongers need your support."
CCP and the people's republic of China are the cancer to civilization.
It should be fixed for the world.

Man everyone there is a million times braver than I ever could be.
"Good luck, I wish you guys well."
People crying about how Pepe is a HaTe SyMbOl are demonstrating that we're are already becoming desensitised to what's happening in Hong Kong.
How about you focus on the young woman who's gotten shot by the establishment for fighting for her freedom?
PepeHands
There are literally Instagram accounts that are trying to raise awareness about the situation in Hongkong and their posts are being deleted
Lol people in the US think the frog symbolizes white supremacy
But Pepe is a white nationalist racism symbol!
-CNN's Fredo
Imagine having political beliefs so fragile that your world is shattered upon learning that a cartoon frog is actually not a universal symbol of hate and that context is actually importantYou're imagining reddit
Remember when Reddit and the media told us that Pepe was a white nationalist symbol.
Those were the days
According to the American propaganda media-  That’s Racist!
Reddit idiots are torn.
Support HK or continue to claim that Pepe is a symbol of hate.
Just to clarify this isn't the lady who got beanbagged in the eye.

Locked because some people are trying to organize brigades here.
But I'm confused.
This is winnie the pooh.
Why is it banned ?
Winnie has looked like this for decades.
I'll admit I don't see the resemblance between them but the unbelievable insecurity of the Chinese to this is way funnier than the actual comparison.
Oh bother.
"Out of the loop, why Winnie the Pooh?"

Xi Jiping's taunting comes with musical accompaniment.
I wonder if it's illegal to whistle this melody.
"**EDIT: Hold your upvotes, everyone."
"It appears I've made a mistake and relayed false information from the video (Namely, the fact that a VPN is not required for Steam in China)."
"I am sorry, I trusted it before I did any research to verify it and for that I apologize."
"Here is the video if you're curious, the part I'm referring to starts around 9:07."
"~~~~Ironically, since Steam was never officially allowed in China, they had to use a VPN to access Steam to post the reviews, thus bypassing their dear leader's regulations."
But did he harvest bear organs for this look?
The good old “ this picture is illegal” karma farm

another spineless dictator?
Why is it that authoritarians are such whiny bitches?
Disrespectful to Winnie the Pooh.
I don't get it.
"If Xi Jinping doesn't want to be compared to Winnie the Pooh, why did he have the surgery to look like him?"
"Wow man you did it, you totally owned china"
"Just another reminder that Winnie the Pooh IS NOT banned in China, a quick Baidu search reveals this."
Just try typing in “Winnie the Pooh” into Baidu’s search bar.
Will you get banned or blocked if you share this on WeChat?
Disney's trademark is strong in china.
"Welp we’ve done it guys, China is no more"
"which means it's probably illegal on Reddit, too."
"EDIT: Oh, the irony."
My comment is the last one before the post was locked.

it makes him look cuddly and nice instead of a murderous communist dictator.
"The fact that people believe this is true, and that it somehow ""gets to"" the CCP, is laughable and frankly betrays the maturity of most people on Reddit."
You want to fight the good fight go become a political activist instead of memeing bullshit on r/pics.
is it illegal?
"these posts are just like the ""Beyonce's manager is trying to remove these photos from the internet!"
"""They're offensive, but I'm not sure they are actually illegal."
"If you want to make a difference, why not use a post like this to spell out the human rights abuses in China?"
In before the Chinese investors call head office to get this taken down.
[removed]
We did it Reddit!
Authoritarianism is no more!
Reddit users regularly tell me that this site is controlled and censored by china.
That means this picture isn't allowed to be posted here either!
"Should ban this specific image here, it's poorly done."
At the very least someone make a better version.
They do not let you be creative.
Slavery.

Images of Whinny the Poo are ban in China
"I'm not saying it is incorrect, but is it really illegal?"
There just seems to be a lot of things like this for upvotes or Facebook Likes.
"On Facebook they will typically say ""Share this before it gets taken down again"" but bullshit was it ever taken down; it's just a ploy to get you to fight the system and share it."
Meanwhile some 14yr old is telling his mates how his post has gone viral.
We did it Reddit!
This will surely destroy him as a man and as president!
PRINTED 100 OF THESE AND MAKING PAPER AIRPLANES OUT OF THEM AND THROWING THEM INTO CHINA.
THEY CANT STOP ALL OF THEM
People in mainland China on reddit scrolling through just had a panic attack someone else might see.
Streisand effect is a bit sweeter when the target is a chubby dictator
"Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the PoohNothing happened in Tienanmen Square in 1989 so don't ask*whistles tunelessly*"
"God if there was any example of the Streisand Effect, this is it."
"For those who don’t know, the SE is that by being defensive about something you actually call a ton of attention to it and you end up making the problem way worse."
China has no sense of humor
What a fucking loser
Fuck Xitler
No it isn't
Pro China comments on here are hilarious.
"There's so many of them, you'd think there wasn't a dictator running China, imprisoning a million Uighurs, and trying to subjugate HK or something."
"OP is a Chinese karma farm bot, you've all been bamboozled"
Please don’t disrespect Winnie the Pooh he is a huge part of my childhood
The honey pot lapel pin is a nice touch.
"Actually, there are regions in China where bees went completely extinct due to to excessive use of insecticides."
The one who controls the hunny controls the world.
Do one of him making out with that gay Putin pic while trump watches in the background
"To be honest, this is not OPENLY illegal."
"Just that you couldn't post this on the major social media and if you did, your post will most likely disappeared."
It’s not illegal
r/confusedboners
What are you going to do Reddit censor it or what
I'm curious what disney did with the winnie the pooh rides now.
"See, normally I could give a shit about pictures like this."
"They're base, and frankly kind of silly."
But the fact it's illegal is also fucking goofy.
"Meanwhile in the rest of the world, we fly balloons with Trump in a diaper."
I wannapost this in r/China
Why did you guys post a blank image
Waiting for TenCent to take this down.
Why would an unaltered picture of Glorious President for Life be illegal?
Haha what a madlad!
"We stand with you Hong Kong we will repost this image everyday until you guys stop getting shot in the chest and tear gassed and other human rights violations, But we will support you by making funny images that get a lot of gold"
This image is an insult to Winnie the Pooh.
That scum is not worthy of the Pooh Bear.
Can we post it to r/China
Oh you guys are really slaying China here.
I'd be surprised if they ever recover from having their leader compared to an adorable lovable figure.
Have you ever wondered why Reddit's new owner does not deleted these memes?

"Thanks op, i needed a laugh and i ended up giggling like a moron because of this."

Oh *bother*.
"They ""elected"" him leader for life."
What kind of fucked up Frankenstein's monster is China?
I like this more and more every time I see it.

Was this even altered?
"Say what you will about America, but at least we can have photoshopped pictures of Trump with Shrek ears and green skin."
"And to think, there are people out there who genuinely believe that the United States right now is worse than China right now"
Someone should make a deepfake video
Fuck China!
fuck xi jiping
Now which brave soul is gonna post pics of tiananman square with the same title for that sweet karma
"Yup, it's totally the **People's Republic of China**."
not some fascist state that's been in the making for decades.
Beyoncé wants this removed from the Internet!
But why?
"He just looks so cute as Winnie the Pooh, and everyone actually loves that silly ol' bear."
It would probably do wonders for his image if he just accepted it.
I teach at an international business school.
We have lots of Chinese students.
I have spoken to them about this and they swear they have never heard of this.
One of them even told me that Winnie is popular in China.
so I guess they are censoring the censorship or the students are specifically instructed to say the opposite.
How long before big daddy tencent ~~forces~~ strongly suggests that the mods remove this post for violating some arbitrary rule that's never usually enforced?
That very dangerous in a totalitarian regime like the Chinese
This is offensive to Pooh.
Even 💩 is offended by comparing pooh to Xi.
This is the exact same fucking thing as the gay Putin post being constantly reposted.
This image will probably follow the same path
Are those nilla wafer ears?
"""What day is it today, Piglet?"
"""""It's the day we punish the disloyal, and reiterate that western democracy is a decadent and flawed sociopolitical concept."
"""""My favorite day."
Hong Kong protestors should start putting up this picture all over the city
"Also, posting this picture gets you on the organ donor list!"
"out of all the bizarre shit i've seen humanity come up with, Xi Jiping getting mad about being photoshopped into Winnie the Pooh is probably in the top 3"
"Well, it _is_ insulting to Winnie the Pooh."
Why do people keep insulting Winnie the Pooh like this
[removed]
Can you imagine being this insecure lmfao
Let's see how long this post lasts
i thought it was illegal to compare Jiping to Poo.
i remember John Oliver doing a segment about it and it's now a regular feature of his opening credits.
[removed]
Those pancake ears.
This guy makes Trump look like Gandhi
Nice pin lol
I’m sure Trump would like to take a page out of that playbook.
Xi Jipooh
Xi Jiping the poo.
I think you mean Xi Jinpooh
I'll seriously never understand why he gets to upset about this.
"Like it's Winnie the Pooh, I look like Brad Pitt and you don't see me complaining, Xi should be proud to look like a loveable cartoon bear whose face gets stuck in a honey jar."
His ears look like vanilla wafers lol
China owned epic style 😎
Oh now I see the resemblance yeah that guy looks like Pooh Bear
Melt some butter on those ears dip 'em in honey yum
"Maybe it should be illegal here, because that is some nightmare fuel"
I wish I was so full of life people laugh at my funeral.
What a beautiful idea to keep people happy
This made me laugh but then made me sad that the world lost such a funny man
Laughter does help a lot when dealing with grief.
Good on this passed-on soul.
This guy would have been fucked if he got buried alive
"It is funny, but mostly heartwarming."
It seems pretty apparant this man loved to bring joy to others and even wanted to continue making people smile after he passed.
Sure he'll be missed.
"After my Irish Grandmother's funeral, everybody was back at the house, and the mood was pretty somber, when a bolt of lightning hit nearby and the thunder shook the house."
"My father looked up and said ""She just got to heaven and found out they let protestants in""."
"Everyone laughed, and after that it was a real Irish wake."
This guy puts fun in funeral.
EDIT: gold and silver?
Y tho?
"My god this is wholesome as hell, make everyone have a good laugh at your funeral,beautiful."
When my sister and I were leaving my mom's funeral after a brutal few weeks (she was diagnosed with and died of cancer in under a month) we had had the ashes separated so we could each take some.
Needless to say we were under insane amounts of stress and had nowhere to put it.
"So when the bags with the urns were handed out to us, I cracked ""you take the torso, I'll get the legs"" before I could stop myself."
We fucking lost it.
We were in hysterics the entire way out among the sea of mourners trying to console us thinking we were just in paroxyms of grief.
Little did they know we couldn't speak for laughter.
"It took a load off, and my mom sure as hell would have appreciated that smartass remark."
Takes some courage to record such a thing.
"Mission accomplished, everyone laughing at a funeral."
My grandfather had a recording of him play after his funeral that simply said I don't know if I'm above you or below you but I'm watching you.
It made me laugh but I miss him a lot.
"Wow, this got me crying."
So sad for those left behind to lose such a fun personality.
God bless
The Irish have such a beautiful way about them.
Their easy humour and sharp quick wit have saved many an awkward situation and lightened up dark moments.
They are special people.
This is fantastic!
He knew just what his loved ones needed that day.
"a good solid laugh, no doubt followed by a few pints of Guiness afterwards."
What a beautiful soul.
Thank you for this.
I'm literally writing my father's eulogy today for his service in two days.
"I've been torn whether I want to be somber and respectful for how I want to be to him, or lighthearted and fun, as i know he'd be annoyed we were taking it all so seriously."
"Honor the memory of life, not the moment of death, go with fun."
Thank you.
"TD;DL (too Deaf, didn’t listen) What did he say?"
What a great thing for him to do for those left behind.
Seems like a fun fellow.
Hope he's happy wherever he is.
This is by far the best way to say goodbye.
"I don’t even know the guy, but I miss him already!"
This is about as Irish as a joke gets
Can anyone get any info on this amazing but deceased being?
"His name was Shay Bradley and he died Oct, 8th 2019."
ie/death-notice/shay-bradley-kilnamanagh-dublin/400629)
It’s amazing but sad how he can’t see his relatives laughing.
Seeing people laugh is the best part about being funny.
I can see the casette now.
"Tape with writing in Sharpie saying ""Play this at my funeral."
""" RIP."
When my friend died of cancer he ordered another friend of his to read the eulogy he wrote for himself and ‘dispatched from beyond the grave’.
"It included gags about it turning out the zoroastrians or some obscure religio group being right and everybody better convert while they got the chance, as well as where he had left his outdoor grows of weed, that sort of gag."
Top bloke and made the funeral so much less painful.
This one got me.
"Watching all those people starting out somber, then holding back laughter, to just letting go and wiping their tears even while giggling."
What a powerful and loving gift to leave behind.
Must have been quite a man.
"My Papa (grandfather), in his last hour was reaching for the ceiling and asking God for Cheetos."
"Through all of our tears, we couldn't stop smiling because it was so absurd."
"Only a year since he passed, I miss that man so much."
This made me cry and laugh at the same time
"My daughter promised that she would keep my remains out of site while everyone arrives, then bring me in 15 minutes late saying, ""I always said Dad would be late to his own funeral!"
""" I'm so proud of that girl."
She's gonna be a great mom and a fine dad!
I’m sure he was just as joyful in life.
Good on him for bringing peace in his passing.
I love things like this.
My plan is to leave a safety deposit box filled with stuff to make me seem like I’d been a spy.
"Cash, multiple passports, a gun etc."
"Then a note underneath everything that says, “got you fuckers from beyond the grave."
LEGEND STATUS ACHIEVED!
My condolences to the family and friends on the loss of their loved one.
He seems to have been quite the fellow.
Thank you so much for sharing such a private and epic moment with all the world.
The Irish.
Not much more to say.
A phenomenal people from a small island.
Best folks on earth.
Oddly wholesome
This guy is a Fucking Legend!
Thanks for the laugh kind stranger.
Rest in peace.
I‘m deaf can someone translate please?
I loved it when the person filming pointed the camera into the grave!
He knew he was going to die obviously and the fact that he wanted people to laugh bit not cry says that he wants everyone in that funeral to move on and that he loves them enough to help them even after death.
What a tremendous guy.
Brilliant.
"He definitely did it ""his way""!"
That’s brilliant.
I don’t want my family grieving my loss.
I want them laughing and celebrating me
Saw this after leaving my grandmother's visitation this afternoon.
Funny thing is my family doesn't really take much seriously.
Never been to a family funeral where it wasn't just a celebration or excuse to get together and eat and drink and be merry.
Heading out now to get beer and food.
":)Side note, I've told my close relatives to bury me from 350ft, via trebuchet."
Nobody's gonna be crying as I pinwheel through the air with a backless suit stuck to my neck.
Also if they miss they have to try again.
My Family used to live in a house with really busy train tracks just behind the garden.
So we all were very familiar with the sound of trains rumbling down some steel bars after some time.
The first vacation we did after moving into the house was in Spain.
We rented a little flat in a really nice small town where we planned to spend our holidays.
When we arrived we opened up all the windows to let fresh air into the flat and the first thing we heard was a train passing by real close.
We all said unisono “oh come on!
” These trains were following us everywhere.
But as mentioned beforehand we got used to the sound.
"6 years ago, my father died suddenly and it was a tragedy."
We were all devastated about the sudden loss.
"He was going to be buried in his hometown which was about 3,5h from where we lived."
After the ceremony in the church we went to the graveyard to bury him.
The priest held a speech and just about 3 seconds after he asked for a moment of silence we heard a train in the distance.
The whole family was laughing!
"It was absurd and the priest was quite confused, but we laughed because we knew he was home."
It’s funny how things connect sometimes.
"At the risk of sounding morbid, I freaking love Irish funerals."
at least the ones I've been to on my wife's side of the family.
They're so much more upbeat & joyous compared to the sob fest of the Italian funerals I've attended.
"The fuckin irish, I fuckin luv those bastards :D"
God bless the Irish
Just imagine what a funny guy he was.
Damn.
Sure as shit knows how to lighten the mood.
"As Dolly said in Steel Magnolias: ""Laughter through tears is my favorite emotion."
"Imagine when someone ask how your friends funeral was and you reply ""it was pretty fucking funny""I can only imagine their face trying to understand what you just said"
That's a proper Irish goodbye.
my friend(s) died in a tragic auto accident filled with lots of accusations of group suicide/murder at the age of 26.
When we were his funeral we showed up and his ashes were in this giant brass mortar round that he'd found at some estate sale.
"It was hilarious because his parents just said, ""well, it's what we could find."
""" It had been used for his cigarette butts before that!"
we all *REALLY* needed that laugh (because of all the horrible things said by the community).
and it just spread through out the room.
Imagine walking by this and see everybody laughing
Making people laugh even when you're dead that's a life goal
Daaaaaammnn!
That dude is a badass!
Bless this man
The mad lad did it.
Guy records a funeral.
That was bloody brilliantly!
He must have been an amazing man.
Pure gold!
What a great way to make everyone laugh through heartache.
I didn’t know this guy but i know he was a legend
That’s a great way to be remembered.
"Instead of a somber atmosphere, he’s now got all his loved ones laughing one more time."
I'm reminded of my great uncle's funeral.
"He was Italien, but married into a very Irish Catholic family."
"His brother spoke at his funeral and said ""and I'd just like to remind everyone that my brother was Italian."
""" And ""if my mother was still alive she'd be cursing these damn fiddlers."
I think it's better to laugh during a funeral instead of sobbing.
Cause If I was the one being buried I wouldn't want people to cry.
I would prefer to make them laugh for the last time.
I'm sure it's the same for this man.
What a fucking legend.
There are literally no other words to describe such a person.
"Simply, a fucking legend."
My Gran passed away last year.
There is a bit of a tradition developed in my family the last 20 years that you get cremated then thrown in the creek at an appropriate time in the future with the family marking the occasion by a bbq.
"My Nan passed away, then her and the ashes of my first dog (I guess you can't live the afterlife without a companion) went in the creek together, stuff like that."
My Grandad died maybe 15 years ago and we've been saving him to go in with Gran.
"So the day comes around to tip them both in the creek and I'm in the boat with my uncle and 3 of my cousins, and the rest of the family on the bank watching."
"My cousin takes the lid off of Grandad and goes to tip him out, but he's been in there so long he doesn't come out."
"My cousin winds up as if she's going to bang the urn and force him out - I foresee this not ending well so I take cover as best I can and my cousin wallops the urn, Grandad plops in the creek with a horrible force, everyone in the boat gets covered in ash and I look up to see the family in hysterics."
So glad we started that tradition.
I bet he was extremely well liked.
Look at the crowd.
"I think that's a great idea, go out with a smile."
I had a weird reaction to this.
I teared up.
"What a gift, leaving a fond memory for your loved ones at your funeral."
Changing the tone from somber mourning to humor and a celebration of his life.
"maybe I'm being weird, but r/HumansBeingBros?"
This is awesome but I can’t help imagining the kids there being confused and maybe even traumatized by thinking their grandpa was still alive in the coffin.
As a funeral director for 10 years now I can honestly say I find this absolutely hilarious and I’ve come to find that laughter truly is the best medicine.
even for grief
r/funnyandsad
I’m sure this has already been posted but.
Ain't no party like an Irish wake.
When my dad passed away I put together a slideshow music video of all the photos he'd kept for years back when scrapbooking was a thing.
"About half way through, it showed 3 photos back to back of him on the toilet with his middle finger to the camera."
It was the perfect break from all the crying that had been done over the last few hours.
What I wouldn't give to hear his voice again.
Reminded me of when we were putting my grandfather remains in the mausoleum.
My uncle was putting a keepsake in when he messed with the curtain and it came crashing down.
"The whole family uttered ""Goddammit Michael!"
""" in the same tone as we heard my grandaddy say a million times before."
"Well my uncle Mike turned around like he saw a ghost and said ""I feel like he's here with us."
""" And he was."
Why my family watched my grandfather slowly pass away and heard the final beep of his heart monitor my phone played “it’s raining men” (my brother put it on my phone as a joke) loudly and I went into a panic to shut it off.
After shutting it off there was a moment of awkward silence and then the entire family started cracking up.
We felt it was one last joke from my jokester grandfather.
The Mormon missionary was mortified
Its going to be weird when Ellen has him on her show
Irish + humor + death.
"That's a thing, right?"
I know that cemetery.
"It's bohernabreena, just outside tallaght."
I've got a few friends and relatives buried there.
"You can bet they went to the GAA club next to it after and drank many pints in his honour, remembered the good times and celebrated his life."
Can someone translate for the hearing impaired?
In my family it isn't a funeral till a prank goes down but this is legendary.
"Also, a lot of cemeteries in the US won't let you see them put the casket in the ground."
They end the service and you have to leave.
My grandparents are in a mausoleum.
"I saw them seal up my grandfather, but then changed the rules and I wasn't allowed to stay to watch them intern my grandmother with him."
Imagine how horrifying this would be if he were alive and they were all laughing as they throw dirt on the coffin.
"He really puts the ""FUN"" in FUNeral"
What a fucking baller move
That's amazing.
*runs off to record for eventual funeral *  good on him.
It’s all fun and games until the dark plot twist - there is no recording.
"Fuck being cremated, I want this."
#FuneralGoals
I wanna do this when I die 😂.
I don’t even know this guy but he seems like a cool guy
Imagine just passing by at a funeral and see everyone laughing at someone getting buried.
Plot twist: it wasn’t a recording
"Fantastic, he will be remembered for years"
"Alternative title:""Group laughs as a man begs to be freed while they bury him alive""Pretty wholesome though, and probably a decent comedian."
"I imagine most funerals are tough crowds, let alone your own."
Absolute legend
"Even in death the Irish have the best craic, rest peacefully jokester!"
This is how I wanna go.
Bless his soul
"I found this to be bittersweet, I imagined doing something similar for my funeral to lighten the mood but then I wonder if there’s anyone left alive to even be there."
Very solemn affair scattering my father’s ashes at sea from the beach.
My older brother waded out a way and proceeded to pour out his ashes .
Trouble was .
very strong onshore wind .
You can imagine the rest.
"This, this right here is how you make your final goodbye to grieving family."
No one will ever forget and their last memory if you will be a cheerful one.
10 out of 10 would die again.
I had to think of my grandpa's funeral.
"Besides being the one who held the whole family together, he had a great sense of humor."
"I'll never forget how once he grilled sausages at a family party, wearing a blonde wig, pink lipstick and my grandma's apron dress, and the entire family being in stitches."
"So it came rather naturally that we remembered some of his best jokes at his post-funeral party, and the tears ran down our faces because we laughed our asses off."
"I wonder whether he would've liked this, but I'm certain he's fine with being remembered as someone who brought quite a bit of sunshine into all our lives."
(Edit: Grammar.
Funerals need more of this.
It is supposed to be a celebration of their life.
"Obviously, he was a funny guy."
I both laughed and cried.
the was it should be.
My aunt was known for always having a watergun on her person.
At her funeral she requested a watergun be placed in her coffin so those who came to pay their respects could get a little payback.
Any child there would be fucked after hearing this
"Dont be sad avout the death, celrbrate the life!"
Thats a great way to say goodby.
This is beautiful.
What a wonderful and touching way of reminding people that you live on inside their hearts even after death
If I was at the funeral I'd probably burst out crying at this.
Just reminds me of what we've lost.
He unintentionally made so many people on the Internet laugh too!
Something interesting I noticed about this video.
There is no vault.
The coffin is just sitting in the ground.
Here in America is standard practice to put the coffin in a concrete vault then put that in the ground.
"Also the coffin looks like an old style , “old west” type coffin which I think is really cool."
I’ve never seen that before.
Bet he was a legend when alive.
"This must be hilarious for an adult, but horrifying for a child."
That is no recording they mearly laugh as they bury the safrice
I guess that looks really weird from 50 meters

There needs to be at least one person who thinks this is real and is freaking the fuck out

org/wiki/Rubble_(cat)) (oldest cat that's still alive) turned 31 years old last May.
"EDIT: Holy crap, went to bed last night with around 300 upvotes, now it's over 7000."
"Anyway, to all the people saying that the oldest cat is 38, I am talking about the oldest **living cat,** which is a different record than the oldest cat that has ever lived."
"OP hasn't stated when their cat turned 31 nor if they had a birth certificate, so I thought there may be a chance this their cat was older than Rubble."
Thirty one is an amazing age for a cat!
You must love him so much ♥ Give him some pats from me!
"Tiger has lived a longer life than Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin or Amy Winehouse."
Handsome
Only 90s cats will understand this.
He sure doesn't look that old.
Wow that's impressive.
What a wonderful cat!
You must love him so much!
What are you feeding him and where can I buy this fountain of kitty youth?
DO YOU HAVE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO PROVE IT?
That's crazy.
"My Max is 17 and in a bad state, he went blind last week and we are fighting various cancers."
I have to practically hand feed him now and constantly cleaning the house as he can’t see his litter box anymore.
Had a last Vet meeting last night we’ve decided that this is his last week with us.
Very sad.
I don't know what a 31 year old cat is supposed to look like but he looks pretty good.
"""His feline wisdom is almost palpable."
Kudos to you for taking such good care of him!
You have prolonged his life for sure.
Verified as 31?
I hope my cat lives until she's that old.
I tell her all the time she's not allowed to leave me.
"Damn, he’s older than me."
What have you fed him most of his life?
"""In my day, fancy feast was not only fancy, but a FEAST!"
And my owner could buy it for 65 cents!
You kittens today don't know what you're missing out on!
I believe you have one of the oldest cats in the world rn.
According to Wikipedia (not sure how accurate the list is) you should have the second oldest cat in the world.
A cat named Sasha in Northern Ireland is the oldest living cat at 33.

Long live tiger the great!
"The oldest cat of legitimate verified age went by the Creme Puff, which died at the age of 38 and 3 days."
Its owner had another cat named Grandpa that lived to the age of 35
I want my cat to live that long
My cat is also named tiger and he just turned 17
Look at himmmmm <3 Hopefully I can have my orange for many years to come <3
Happy birthday and many more!
He’s amazing.
Lots of scratches for him
You folks ought to elect him mayor.
Doesn’t look a day over 25
Tiger is older than I am.
"His fur looks so good for that age, I'm amazed."
That's awesome
Holy shit.
He's my age and I'm old AF.
He's a High~~litter~~lander.

Our 27 year old barn cat Cali passed away last year.
She still had a nice coat and good teeth right up until she died.
Deaf and nearly blind but you could hear her ourr a mile away lol
"My god, 31!"
That means he was kicking around back in the 80s.
Has definitely earned the right to chase kids off his lawn :)
Surely not.
If he is he would likely be the oldest cat in the world?

Congrats Tiger!
Keep on going!
Decent kitty right there !
Such a distinguished looking ginger boy 😻
The most famous feline in Illinois history was the notorious Al Catpone.
What!
How the fuck?
My cat died of old age when she was 18!
What kind of fantastical creature is this?
A cat?
Think not!
A 90s cat
What do you feed him?
My cat finally passed at 32.
"Her name was Calico and she was born when my mom was in high school,outlived my grandparents."
"I miss her,she was my first pet."
I'm looking forward to seeing her in heaven.
Oldest cat in Illinois?
He's more than half as old as the state of Hawaii!

Do you have a dated pic with it as a kitten?
If so this could be a Guinness world record holder
Is his name pronounced tiger or tiger?
"“Let me tell you kittens about the 1980s, PetSmart was in its infancy and you could not paw at fish on an iPhone because they did not yet exist, you had to hope that your humans had fish as pets so you could paw at them while the humans slept."

Hey buddy!
That’s an old cat
GO TIGER GO
Hey Tiger!
You're great!
Have a good one buddy!
He's seen a lot of things and knocked most of them off the table.
I will download this picture so he will never be forgotten even if he dies
He remembers what Pepperidge farms doesn't.
Legit had to ask my brother who is a Vet if that was even possible!
Amazing care and awesome cat!
Fist paw Tiger!
Mine just turned 22 and they both are still quite active and jump around.
They have definatly slowed down but I just hope I have at least a few more good years left with them.
Two sisters my brother gave me a year before HE died so they mean A LOT to me beyond the pet/owner bond.
He was a grown cat during George Bush Sr.
's term.
That's crazy.
A cat from the 80s.
"I’m so proud you, Tiger."
"That’s a good looking cat for 31, he looks like a sweet kitten."
Let's just hope that he has a dead man's switch or that the DA already has the important evidence to go after the people involved with him.
Edit: A lot of people don't know what a dead man's switch is.

Related: Remember the woman who reported on the Panama Papers?
"You know, where it was revealed the rich, powerful and famous from all over the world were keeping money in off shore accounts to avoid paying massive amounts of taxes?"
"Yea, she was killed too."
With a car bomb.
This is the same fucking thing and we are letting them get away with it.
"Btw, the woman who reported on the Panama Papers, her name was Daphne Caruana Galizia."
She was an anti-corruption activist.
She was an international patriot and now a martyr.
It’s important we remember that.
Earlier today I was reading an article examining his close relationships with powerful people.
"Hours later, he's dead from suicide."
"Usually I'm skeptical of outrageous coincidences, but this one just doesn't sit right."
Wouldn't he be watched around the clock due to a previous suicide attempt?
Hopefully his accusers continue pursuing justice and all his crimes (and those of his close associates) come to light.
"Everyone said it would happen, but it’s insane to see it actually did."
The fucking balls on these people man.
We needed this guy to squeal.
A lot of powerful people are going to remain hidden because of this.
Dont let the story die with him.
I guess suicide watch exists to watch alleged sex traffickers kill themselves before they give up names.
Before he could give up names of course.
Who will be held accountable?
"Fishy as fuck man, shouldn’t he have been on suicide watch after the last attempt?"
God fucking damn it.
This is outrageous.
"""Phew"" - Prince Andrew"
Unless I see video of him actually doing it I refuse to believe this isn't a hit.
How convenient for those who were involved with him.
What a miscarriage of justice.
They can still round up Ghislaine Maxwell to answer for all of this.
"They'd better do it soon before she disappears or ""commits suicide"" also."
ETA: I'd also add that the damning testimony against Glenn Dubin and Eva Andersson-Dubin (billionaire couple deeply involved with Epstein and now seemingly involved in the trafficking itself) in yesterday's info dump hints that this may be more of an underage sex trafficking network than we even know at this point.
"So while it's shit that Epstein's dead, there are many more avenues to persue - providing law enforcement actually does its job here."
ETA ETA: These twitter threads do a great job at pulling out relevant and damning info from the 800 pages of info dumped yesterday.
Lots of names here.
The first one in particular illustrates what a monster Ghislaine Maxwell is.
The suicide watch wiki page has been edited to say.
">Suicide watch is an intensive monitoring process used to ensure that a person, with the exception of Jeffery Epstein, cannot attempt suicide."
wikipedia.
org/wiki/Suicide_watch
"This case must move forward, unbelievable that he was even able to commit suicide."
People must answer for what happened.
Can’t we get one fucking win?
I just wanted this piece of shit to turn on everyone and see a bunch of disgusting perverts sent to jail.
Well if he had a deadmans switch now would be the time.
"Edit: I said IF he did, I’m not saying he has one."
I’m not one for the tinfoil hat.
But what the fuck.
That's an awfully convenient suicide.
And now the victims may never get justice.
The rich and powerful have no rules.
We are so fucked as a society if this just goes away.
"Here's to hoping the prosecutors will continue with their case and release their findings, or at least release all the evidence so the public can scour through them."
These victims deserve justice.
UPDATE: SDNY prosecutors say they will continue their investigation against co-conspirators.

Somebody pulled some strings with their billions to make sure he didn't speak their names.
Fuck!
That's how many powerful people were at risk.
We cant take this one quietly.
"As an emergency room medic, if one of my patients on suicide supervision was able to successfully commit suicide I would lose my license, likely suffer jail time and most certainly suffer civil suit."
If one has insurance that will get hit in addition to the above plus the policy will likely be voided.
[deleted]
How convenient.
Suicide on a Friday night/Saturday morning which is conveniently the time when the least amount of people are checking the news.
And he still managed to commit suicide despite being on suicide watch since the first attempt.
I'm no conspiracy theorist but if there was ever a case to be made.
&#x200B;Edit: As has been brought up repeatedly he was not on suicide watch at the time of death.
"While this is great for people who want to verify all the facts, in the end it means if someone was trying to kill him their job was made easier."
All I can say is I hope Julie K Brown from the Miami Herald keeps this story alive to benefit his victims and hold others who are responsible accountable.
"Oh, and fuck you Epstein."
Rot in hell.
She should get a Pulitzer for her work on this.
This is an aberration of justice.
The jail staff should be held accountable.
How is this possible?
I guess suicide watch was just that?

What a coincidence!
The day after all these docs drop
The one fuckin time I want a pedophile to stay safe and sound.
I've went to a mental health facility while I was in the military.
"Nothing fancy, just a normal facility with a military wing."
"While I was in there, I was on suicide watch."
"Everything was ""suicide-proof""."
"Slanted tops of doors to avoid hanging yourself, bathroom privacy was less than desired, etc."
"I was cleaning my room out of boredom, and I wiped a paper towel past a hidden sensor on the door, not even 10 seconds later, 6 staff members come busting in the fucking room."
"We all had a good laugh after, but generally speaking, I'm a ""nobody""."
So please tell me how someone of his status was able to slip through the cracks.
The whole system is diseased.
"Even if it was suicide, no one will believe that."
"No one will believe that the first world is no longer relatively free of corruption, either."
Very fucking suspicious.
I’m not normally one to get into conspiracy theories but come the fuck on.
He was supposedly on suicide watch at the jail.
It’s hard not to see this at the very least as willfully not protecting his life.
"Edit: For more context, he was being held in MCC Manhattan, which is where they had been holding El Chapo during trial."
Very high security.
They most definitely have capabilities to monitor inmates 24/7.
"On top of this, his being on suicide watch makes this very suspicious."
And people still question why Cory Feldman never named names.
**A global sex trafficker who could implicate some of the richest and most powerful people on Earth as pedophiles died in jail while under suicide watch in federal prison on the very night that his case files were unsealed.
**I am officially a conspiracy theorist on this one.
"CNN this morning: ""It makes sense, Epstein was used to a cushy life, not jail""Really CNN?"
Case closed?
Or is it your owners/top donors were getting really fucking nervous and did something.
a bit rash.
Weird how almost all media outlets immediately report it as suicide rather than ’found dead.
’ ”dies by suicide””Found dead by suicide” ”killed himself in prison” ”Kills himself in prison””Commits suicide in Manhattan jail.

"If you’re surprised Epstein killed himself, just imagine how surprised he was."
NYPost has some possibly NSFW photos of the body.
Who had him in custody and why do they still have a job?

How the fuck do they let this shit happen!
"If he was on suicide watch, his cell must’ve been loaded with cameras."
**We need to demand to see video.

I guess ‘suicide watch’ just means the guards watch you commit suicide.
"Let me take this moment to say that anyone wanting to repost this image can do so, even without crediting me, as this is the sort of joke that won't still be fun a week from now cause by then something much more stupid than this will have already have happened in reality."

"Edit 2: I can only laugh at this now, he was taken off suicide watch."
Are you fuckin kidding me?
"Having worked in a prison, there's no way he should have been able to commit suicide if he was on suicide watch."
"Granted, I didn't work in NY but I have to believe that regs for that kind of thing are pretty standard."
"Prisoners on suicide watch are placed in an empty  cell, stripped naked and given a one piece garment made of thick quilted canvas like material,  sort of like a poncho."
We called these bam bam suits and they are damn near indestructible.
Not only that but they are monitored by cctv.
Yo my favorite part is how MATT FUCKING GROENING was name dropped being ON his jet getting a foot massage from a 14 YEAR OLD GIRL and how so many redditors gaslighted that detail out of existence because he's an idol.

"Everybody has basically been waiting for this, how can the jail/wherever he is held allow him to kill himself?"
The most obvious turn of events imaginable.

He killed himself *while on suicide watch* wtfedit: i guess he was taken off suicide watch--- after reportedly having attempted suicide.
Seems logical to me.
"Also, don't award my post guys."
Go buy a homeless person a meal or something.
"Uh huh, he got suicided all right."
He 100 percent got murdered.
He knew too much.
Here's hoping he was a smart blackmailer and had some sort of dead mans switch to release everything in case of his death.

"He was held in a cell block where the inmates' cells are under 24/7 CCTV surveillance, even when they're taking a shower."
* But somehow none of the prison staff noticed him hanging himself in his cell.
* Some reports are saying the guards were all busy watching TV on their cell phones and that's why they didn't notice his suicide attempt till about an hour after he started it.
* Apparently the prison has a powerful union so it's unlikely the guards will be investigated or even called to testify about his death under their watch.
">*His death came less than three weeks after he was found unresponsive in his cell at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, with marks on his neck that appeared to be self-inflicted, sources told ABC News."
*So jail staffs didn't keep a close eye on him?
Let’s all hope for a dead-man’s switch.
That would be the best case scenario out of this.
Someone got very scared.
forbes.
it's a whole fuckin' list.
"The net has been closing in on him for a while, and he took a plea deal in Florida earlier this year on similar charges and spent thirteen months in a very low-security jail, but he was arrested in Manhattan last month after the plea deal was found to have broken federal law."
"This is a *big deal*, not only because it would be one of the highest-profile child sex crime prosecutions in years, but also because of Epstein's rumoured (and not-so-rumoured) personal relationships with politicians on both sides of the aisle."
"It's also important because one of the most prominent allegations against Epstein directly involves Donald Trump, as well as regular Trump supporter (and Epstein's possibly-former lawyer) Alan Dershowitz."
"After an alleged suicide attempt three weeks ago, in which Epstein was found with injuries to his neck that were reported to have been self-inflicted, Epstein was found dead in his cell on the morning of August 10th."
This is all a *big deal*.
"**A Little History**Jeffrey Epstein was rich, and very well-connected."
"(The two things are, as you might expect, inextricably linked."
") His net worth wasn't known, but most estimates put it in the single-figure billions."
Epstein was famous for being.
"let's be generous and say 'eccentric', and his behaviour was often at odds with what's expected for someone of his standing."
Even the details of what he did for a living aren't well known.
"“He once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I’ve also heard that he manages Rockefeller money."
But one never knows.
It’s like looking at the Wizard of Oz – there may be less there than meets the eye.
"”>Says another prominent Wall Streeter: “He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque figure."
"He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of aloofness."
The whole thing is weird.
"”At one point, he was rumoured to spend some 600 hours in the air every year -- the equivalent of over three weeks in a plane -- examining 'business opportunities' (per the *New Yorker* article)."
"However, one thing that *was* known about Epstein is that -- for all of his claims of being quiet, not drinking and never taking drugs -- he was (depending on your definition) in the inner-circle of some high-profile individuals, including [the UK's Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Woody Allen, Katie Couric, Kevin Spacey, Tom Barrack, and Donald Trump."

html)Both of these things will be important later.
"#RumoursEpstein's name has long been associated with paedophilia, with complaints going back at least as far as 2005 that he was abusing girls as young as 14 in his Palm Beach Mansion."
"Accusations at the time suggested that Epstein was paying girls for sexually-suggestive massages, but over time more and more complaints rolled in."
"A investigation was brought about, and the FBI found strong evidence that Epstein had engaged in activities with girls under the age of 18 -- or, let's not put too fine a point on it here, child sexual abuse."
This is when things get a bit fucky.
"In 2008 Epstein was offered what was reported in the media as the deal of a lifetime: in short, he would agree to agree to plead guilty to state prostitution charges, register as a sex offender, and pay restitution to three dozen victims identified by the FBI."
"His guilty plea resulted in a sentence of 18 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach County jail (which later became 13 months and a year of parole), with a private security team and 12 hours of 'work release', six days a week, where he was abl to go to his offices."
"In return, the government agreed to grant immunity from all federal criminal charges -- and consider that the FBI recommended pursuing charges of four counts of unlawful sex with minors and one count of molestation -- along with four co-conspirators and any unnamed 'potential co-conspirators'."
"For a year and a half in jail (well, 'in jail'), Epstein ensured that anyone else involved in his crimes would go untroubled."
"The indictment (all 53 pages of it) was sealed, preventing the details from becoming public."
"The prosecutor who made this deal -- which was widely slammed in the press as unjust -- was Alexander Acosta, Secretary of Labor in the Trump Administration (until he was forced out as a result of the negative attention, a couple of days after the story broke)."
"His legal team included Alan Dershowitz, and (lead investigator in the Clinton impeachment) Ken Starr."
**A Hell of a Deal.
"Overturned**Epstein got out of jail, but the accusations kept coming."
"None of them are what you'd call pleasant to read, but more and more of them accused not only Epstein of horrific sexual abuses, but also high-profile friends of his."
"Consider the fact that some of these accusations included Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, and you realise that you're talking about a *big fuckin' deal* if any of this stuff ever gets corroborated."
"Also consider that the FBI found cameras all over Epstein's house, suggesting that he was using them to create blackmail material for high-profile guests at his at-the-very-least-statutory rape parties."
"(Thanks to the sealed indictment, that can only be speculative."
") These accusations continued, and led to some lawsuits, several of which were settled out-of-court by Epstein."
"org/newshour/politics/assault-allegations-donald-trump-recapped) take this one, without further comment:>**“Jane Doe” aka “Katie Johnson” – 1994."
"** Lawsuit filed June 2016, refiled October 2016 as reported by Buzzfeed and others, then dropped in November 2016."
"Jane Doe is an unnamed plaintiff, who has also gone by “Katie Johnson” in legal papers."
"She claims she was repeatedly raped by Trump and Jeffery Epstein at Epstein’s New York City apartment in 1994, when she was 13 years old."
"A witness, also given a pseudonym — “Tiffany Doe” — said she recruited “Jane Doe” and others."
"Doe, using the name “Johnson,” gave an interview to the *Daily Mail* in which she said she did not know who Trump was at the time of the alleged attack but identified him later when she saw him on television."
It is not known why she withdrew the lawsuit.
She has not spoken publicly or withdrawn her rape allegation since then.
"(To clarify, this is not one of the cases that was known to be settled out of court by Epstein; Katie Johnson's reasons for dropping the lawsuit are unknown at this time."
")Now, let's not mince words here: Epstein and his lawyers did whatever they could to get him the lowest possible sentence and hide his crimes from public scrutinty."
Even Alexander Acosta noted that Epstein's lawyers had gone to unusual lengths to get what they wanted:>Acosta explained in a 2011 letter that he allowed for Epstein’s short sentence after “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by the financier’s “army of legal superstars.
"”>“The defense strategy was not limited to legal issues,” Acosta wrote."
"“Defense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification."
"” However, earlier this year a Florida court found that Acosta's team had violated federal law when they failed to disclose Mr."

but yeah this totally happened.
Not staged at all.
nuh uh.
No way.
Nadda.
ziltch.
zero.
Looks like he got caught cheating
Okay.
"First of all, no sweat?"
Bullshit.
Sunglasses on shirt?
Bullshit.
Framing of the photo?
Bullshit.
Posing of dudes body?
Bullshit.
Looking directly at the camera?
Bullshit.
Need I go on?
"Judging by his shirt he probably said ""ope, sorry!"
jpg) yet?
"Hell yeah he has a brewers shirt on, any chance that’s in Wisconsin"
he's not jogging he's eloping
What's with those two people in the back photo bombing this cool guy doing a dynamic pose?
Jogs with sunglasses hanging in the collar?
Not sure I trust this guy.
"Story is bullshit, nobody runs while their glasses are hanging off their shirt."
"Not only fake, but gay as well."
Why they not center frame though  🤔🤔🤔
Fake.
Not a jogger.
See you all in the PSbattle
It looks like your proposal has stumbled into his jogging photo.
It screams *staged*.
I'm calling bullshit on this photo.
"This very good looking man has some great Nike sneakers, as does the girl in the background."
And they're all just a little too in focus for a candid motion shit.
Everything about this feels staged and looks creepily unnatural.
Edit: Typos.
Go Brewers
Pauly D should watch where he's going
"If this ever happens to you when you are taking the photo, wait for the photobomber to leave the frame and then take another photo with the same background, even if “the moment” has passed."
"It’s much easier to photoshop out something unwanted if you have a background to fill it with, it’s a lot more complicated and time consuming to “invent” a background"
"Okay, dude who's doing the proposing here - what the hell is he doing with his right ankle?"
ITS MISTA STEAL YO GIRL
Why are the subjects not centered?
The right side of the frame just so happened to have the exact amount of space to capture the runner.
"He’s the center of the picture, his sunglasses are perfectly placed mid run and the best part is, his arms are running forward but his legs are running back."
Mmkay.
"God dammit, we are upvoting Nike Ads now?"
This image is a Nike advertisement I'm sure of it.
Dog in the picture : don’t do itGuy on one knee: should I really do it Nike : just do it !
r/photoshopbattles
Ah yes the classic Lincoln Park south pond engagement pic
Ridiculously attractive photo bomber
I don’t think this was a legit photobomb.
"I mean, it could be, but imagine the photo without him there."
That’s pretty odd positioning for a photo.
This photo is not centered.
It's not even the preferred thirds.
This photo is perfectly framed to capture the other person; not even his outstretched arm is cut off.
"So either this was cropped for absolutely no fucking reason, or this is bullshit."
And since it's the internet I'm leaning towards bullshit.
"Oh come on, y’all really believe this shit huh"
And I oop!
Is that a weird kneeling position?
Look at the back foot
Jogger aside.
that is a strange framing for an engagement photo.
The basic awkwardness of a decent person trying not to ruin a moment is a thing of beauty.
Are we gonna meme this guy or what?
Can't wait to see this on r/photoshopbattles
looks like a weird nike ad
The dog's face is more terrifying than anything
This is completely staged lol
Why is the framing of this picture not focused on the proposal?
I declare shanangins!
Ridiculously photogenic tho
"Great pic, and dude isn’t even breaking a sweat, lol."
I look like I’m seconds from death at all times during a jog.
The moment you realized he shouldn't plan a proposal in a busy place easily obstructed by pedestrians.
"No headphones, sunglasses on his shirt, not in motion at all, and supes photogenic ."
"this wasn’t a jogger, this was staged AF."
He’s hot
That looks incredibly fake.
The way he's leaning backwards doesn't look like anybody runs or would stand after stopping running.
And the position of the arms looks very posed.
Did you know that ska came b4 reggae?
How is someone that photogenic while they are 1.
Jogging 2.
Photobombing and 3.
Probably dying a little inside as he realizes he’s *ruining* the photo** He totally made this picture 100 times better
"The Simpsons have aliens that like to consume human flesh, well fuck me."
"Sometimes I feel Trump is purposely trying to recreate scenes from ""The Simpsons""."
Which season and episode is it?
Time travel is real.
I’m honestly getting scared of how prophetic The Simpsons is proving to be
Ok some of this shit is way too close to be just an accident
HOW DO THEY KNOW
What if the simpsons is really just making a real-life adaptation and we are all in it
She is like the oldest 16 year old Girl in the world
The last two slides are from the simpsons movie.
The one about a big dome and the naked bart.
I dont know where you got the first one but trump was not in the movie at any stage.
"At this point, I don’t know why we don’t just watch old Simpsons episodes so we can see the future"
[deleted]
Ight this shit not funny anymore
This shit scary at this point
This thing with Simpsons predicting the future is gettin outta hand.
Mum come pick me up im scared.
Holy shit.
Area 51 too.
"I don't understand, why so many people hate this girl?"
Greta gonna be President then?
Make America Greta Again
What's their prediction on Bitcoin price?
One day Trump will announce that the sun is evil and must be blocked AND that he wants to steal candy from a kid and the sad thing is i wouldn’t be surprised one bit.
"""Kids today are so lazy, all they do play video games and sit on their phones all day."
"""\*kid actually steps up and becomes politically active\*""How dare you be active in politics, youre not mature enough!"
"The top left image is altered to include Lisa, she did not appear in the original scene."
"Furthermore, the other images aren’t from the same episodes."
"and once again photo shop has helped people believe a conspiracy,"
Unbelievable how so many people are falling for this
Ignorance is bliss.
"so a priest says to a native chief “if you don’t believe in Jesus you won’t get into heaven, and you will go to hell."
” So the chief replied “well what if we never knew about him?
Would we still go to hell?
” The priest said “well no.
” So the chief said “then why did you tell us?
Matt groening is just a time traveller
I feel like humanity is trying to recreate Simpsons.
"It's almost like if you throw a few thousand darts at a board, some might hit."
illuminati 100
This is starting to get scary.
And its spooky season.
OK who let Matt inside the time machine
Two different episodes.
"But hey, whatever helps fit your narrative."
"DaAam, so we sure we aren’t in a simulation?"
Wont believe any Simpsons meme till I see what episode was that.
Ill be glad when next month gets here.
God damn Simpsons you’re kinda freaky
I’m pretty sure the world ended in 2012 and we are just in some sort of weird computer simulation now.
Life is imitating art far too frequently.
This is false.
The top one with Trump and Lisa is photoshopped.
At this point I wouldn't be surprised if we find out the writers are real time travelers.
Like they're the only ones who managed it and destroyed the tech afterwards or something.
I have never seen that top left scene from any simpsons episode and if the hundreds of people on Reddit can’t obviously figure it out then it’s definitely just a fake episode that someone drew for clickbait
Man that show has been predicting the future for decades now
Just trying to get karma
108k upvotes.
bloody hell
sImpSoN PrEdICtEd AgAaiN
"I can't believe still fall for this already disproven bullshit, and at 116k upvotes?"
I’m pretty sure these pictures are pulled from different episodes.
lisa was a free thinker and not a puppet of her actor parents.
"A reddit post with 100+k upvotes, hmm"
The first panel is Photoshoped
Don't forget that Lisa becomes president in Simpsons
Why is this the second top post of this sub
can some people upvote my comment so i can get some karma to post in some subs that i like
I like Trump
How the fuck are they so accurate
Yeah that top one is BS.
"To the best of my knowledge, their has never been anything close to that shot in the show"
"This not funny any more, Did anyone find out who was the Time Traveler ?"
Except in the Simpsons people gave a shit about what Lisa said
Those two are from completely different episodes
"Unless you're giving the episode, this is nothing more than photoshop for the pic of her staring and one clip from the Simpsons movie."
Not the same episode.
not freaky.
Source: me.
Bruh these writers have been making satire for decades.
"At a certain point, the shit has to feel predictable."
"Couple that with the human mind begging to find connections between anything to make sense of our physical world, and its gonna seem like they have a crystal ball."
"Reality is, they just hire astute, attentive, talented writers on that show."
Who's the girl
"*clears throat*""Trump Bad""*waits patiently for karma and arrows*"
"Why do people call this things predictions, it’s not like they say what happens in the show it’s gonna happen and then it happens."
"It’s a show that makes fun of society sometimes exaggerating things in a funny and comical way and guess what, sometimes real life and real stories are funny and comical, that’s when the two things coincide."
"662 episodes and a movie, you bet it has some connection with reality, cause it’s based on it!"
No illuminati shit going on
Still don't believe in time travel?
"I’m out of the loop, who’s the girl?"
How do you find these so quickly?
I need episode references.
Asking for a friend
[removed]
Wtf is up with the writers off the Simpsons and predicting the future?
whats so hard to phantom about this?
Lisa has always been smart and outspoken in The Simpsons.
Its not really weird or random that she is opposing to the government
What episode is the top left photo from?
EPA EEEEPPPPAAA!
Groening is prophet.
Praise Matt.
[deleted]
This kid is way too pushy!
this is getting disturbing at this point ngl
Yeah I’m really starting to think whoever made the simpsons is a time traveler
Is that the sound of butting in?
It must be Lisa Simpson!
Springfield’s answer to a question nobody asked!
this shit just scared me.
i mean wtf this happens way too much to just be accidents
"This shit ain't funny anymore,this is some high-quality conspiracy crap"
Pushy kid nags town
i’m convinced they have a psychic on the writing team
Who is this girl?
Lol “pushy kid nags town”
gematrinator.
EPA EPAAAAA!
When is that happening?
"Please, please, please tell me there's an episode where Trump gets run over by a parade of steam rollers"
"This has to so with statistics because of the amount of episodes, 620 i believe."
Yet its still funny and scary to find the patterns
"I think Matt Groening lives at area 51, or maybe area 51-A"
"If I recall, this didn't end very well in the Simpsons."
"no one is going to talk about the episode where lisa convinced everyone to give up their guns just in the name of one dead guy who died because of a gun, and that dead guy came back from the dead with a gun to dominate the city because, well, _he was the only one with a gun_ forcing homer to go back in time and stop her before she screw everything up by being manipulated by the dead man?"
lisa and greta thunberg are both a stubborn
Ay this junk creeps me out.
"Except when asked questions, Lisa would have cogent and relevant answers."
"that's so cool, but I think it's going to have to end there."
Lisa becomes President.
I don't see that happening for Ms.
Thunberg unless we change the requirement of of the President being a birth-born U.
citizen.
Doesn’t that girl have ass burgers?
Edit: Hi r/all!
Felix (AKA Pewdiepie) just got married to his wife Marzia yesterday.
"This is a really big thing, because Marzia has been around for almost as long as Felix has been on YouTube, and we all love them as a couple."
"We at 475K now)Edit: for the people asking why sive and i (and no, we aren't the same person lmao) weren't at the wedding; sive had to keep the channel going, and I've never even met felix."
"Weddings are for friends and family, not random internet Moderators :)"
"Damn, that's a beautiful dress :,)"
"I've been watching Pewdiepie for roughly 7 years, and seeing this is just amazing."
It's been an amazing journey.
Congratulations Felix and Marzia!
when i saw marzia’s instagram with some of the photos i was so happy for them
"I don’t know about the rest of you, but pewds looks suave af."
"Never seen an entirely black suit for a groom on his wedding, and marzia looks like a real life princess."
[Congratulations!
My mans did it!
Im so Happy right now.
Am I the only one who was caught by surprise?
We've been waiting forever
Did I see Dave from boyinaband or am I going crazy?
Pewds must be the happiest man alive right now.

"Guys, JaidenAnimations came to the wedding!"
"Walking out the church, hand in hand, followed by the sound of cheers and adoration from family and friends, ready for the first step into their new lives together."
"Marzia asks ""Felix, where is the car?"
"""GET IN THE BOAT"""
"They both look amazing, I wish them I wish them the best of luck on their new life together."
Sven would be proud ❤️
Sooooo fucking happy right nowwwww!
Congrats to the number 1 couple of 2019!
I wish I could send my homegrown 10Kg of potatoes to their honeymoon suite tho.
I just woke up and this instantly made me happy as hell!
I’m genuinely so happy for them omg!
Now frick!
Such a beautiful couple!
"It's been a wild ride, ups and downs, through every charity and controversy,from amnesia to minecraft, we were there along the way, i hope they live a great life together as husband and wife, Brofist for life!"
THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT FOR SWEDEN CONGRATULATED HIM.
"Okay, this is epic."
"The moment you realise that he said he cant wait to be Marzia’s husband in that Addressing The Rumours video, which came out before their wedding."
He said that in anticipation of the wedding later that day (or the next day)!
*Edited because the guy below me didnt understand what i was getting at*
I'm so happy for then
This is cute as fuck.
I remember the Friday's with PewDiePie back when they were in Italy.
I AM CRYINGGGG!
CONGRATULATIONS!

"Congrats, it looks magical guys ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️"
The madlad actually did it
"It's such a weird feeling seeing Pewdiepie in these photos, It's so hard to believe the Anmesia playing Swede I watched 8 years ago is now finally married with the love of his life."
I can't change this feeling off of just.
Happiness for them.
I really hoped they'll release some video of their wedding since it looks so beautiful.
"(And I know they didn't vlog before you comment that, I just have seen people payed to film before at weddings and seeing some video of the Wedding would be the best thing ever)"

I didn't think I would actually fall for it because I usually hover over links and check where they lead to first.
"But in my haste to find a quick link to r/DiavoloDeathCount (because I was too lazy to type it myself), I ignorantly ctrl+f'd it and clicked the first hit."
"So now I'm here, with a face full of Hamon, with the only solace being that the life energy that is destroying me from the inside is that of one of the biggest chads in JoJo's history."

Hello!
This is just a quick reminder for new friendos to [read our subreddit rules.
reddit.
"Be nice, and leave political or religious arguments in other subs."
We believe in you!
"Also, please keep in mind that even if you've see this post before, it's not a repost unless it's been in *this* sub before (if it's from another sub it's a crosspost/xpost)."
We're glad you're here.
reddit.
"And here I am, intentionally going to different stores and gas stations because  I don't want the staff to recognize me as a regular."
This happened to me.
I used to go to Dunkin’ Donuts everyday on break from work and get the same coffee and bag of hash browns.
The guy there knew my order and would always have it ready.
One day I came in and I was in the mood to try something different so I ordered a muffin instead with my coffee.
The guy looks at me and goes “no hash browns?
” And I was like thought I would try something different today.
When he handed me my order he went “I put the hash browns in the bag too cause I already had them ready for you shhh it’s our little secret”.
That bag of free hash browns honestly made my whole day :)))
This is a wholesome level threat
I work at a gas station and honestly this is the shit we live for.
Having loyal customers makes all the other shit we deal with almost worth it.
Ima gear a BONELESS PIZZA and a 2 liter coke
My partner is a smoker and always buys his cigarettes from the same gas station.
One time he was down on his luck after an unexpected bill and went to buy a really cheap pack with some change.
"The guy behind the counter took his money and then grabbed his usual pack of cigarettes and said, ""No, these are the ones you smoke."
"""He's not used to people being nice to him and it really made his week."
He was so surprised the guy would remember his brand and be so kind to him.
"A few weeks later, the guy asked him if he knew anyone looking for a job and he was able to get his out of work friend hired there."
Just an all around wholesome situation.
Update: as of yesterday my partner now works at the gas station on weekends!
Every morning i go to a corner store by my house for a pack of smokes and a monster.
Over the years the clerks have just started getting everything out and ringing it up before i get to the store.
Ive even caught them training new employees to do the same.
"People who work in retail are nice, or they start off nice at least."
People should treat them better.
"This is wholesome sure, but who in gods name buys burritos from a gas station?"
"I’m a little concerned about this manEdit: y’all pls stop blowing my inbox up, I get it, small towns LMAOWhere I live our gas stations aren’t really attached to restaurants or anything."
We have a lot of home-owned roadside diners or little deli shops and general stores _separately_ so I’m just not used to people trusting gas station food
The Waffle House by my house was like this with me for a while.
They’d have a glass of water ready for me and what I wanted already written down.
It was nice
Back in high school my friends and I used to regullarly go to the local 7/11 after we stayed after finishing homework after school.
"There used to be a deal that a hotdogs and large drink was about $2 or $3, and as broke high schoolers the 7/11's parking lot became our hangout spot."
It got to the point where the attendants started to have them in the box ready with an empty cup on the side as soon as we walked in.
"Yeah those hotdogs weren't exactly the greatest by any sense, but being welcomed like that is a special kind of feeling."
"Sometimes at my job, I try to go a little extra for regulars just because they're awesome."
"I hope I've been able to make someone's day like this at least once, too."
This shit warmed my heart.
"Burritos, the great equalizer."
I work in a bakery.
An elderly lady would always come in and ask for the same loaf of sourdough.
She had Crohn’s disease so could only tolerate certain bread.
I started baking it fresh for her every day as she was always so sweet and I wanted it to be fresh for her.
She recently passed away and now I feel sad whenever I bake it because she’s not here to enjoy it anymore.
She was so very sweet.
I miss her.
I highly recommend everyone become regulars at a local place at least once in their life
The perqs of being a friendly regular.
I'm a regular at a local QuikTrip; stop in two (many times three) times a day.
My daughter recently started at a new daycare on the other side of town that puts my regular QT completely out of the way.
"I still go in at lunch time nearly every day, but I was legit sad thinking about not seeing those same employees regularly anymore."
I'm sure I've put a manager's kid through college or something w/ how much money I've spent over the years.
I travel for work and sometimes I go to the same place for months at a time.
I’m a creature of habit and I’ll eat lunch and dinner at like the same 2-4 restaurants the whole time.
I never really announce that I’m leaving so these nice little familiarities I build all over the country just disappear.
I sometimes wonder if they notice I never come back.
I hit the grocery store on the same day at the same time each week.
The guy who stocks the dairy shelves started stocking my yogurts  before the other stuff because he told me he knew to expect me and wanted to be ready.
I always make it a point to seek him out to thank him for his help.
I was the burrito guy to the new girl at the Sonic by my old work because six days a week I showed up at 7:15am and ordered two sausage burritos extra cheese.
"She came over the speaker and was like ""oh hey, your the burrito guy right?"
Bro you eating gas station burritos for dinner every night?
That can’t be good for you.
You know you go somewhere too often when you walk in and they already have your drink half made.
Local strip clubs take my money.
Everybody has their vice.
"That's pretty awesome, but it'd just spike my stupid-ass anxiety."
"On a day when I'm running late, or early, or just don't want a burrito, I'd be worrying about the burrito guy, what if he has to throw away the burritos, blah blah blah."
"As a friend once said, when a cashier knows my ""usual,"" it just makes me want to buy my bread somewhere else."
Imagine how awful it’d be if you suddenly didn’t come one day
That really warmed my burrito.
I wish ppl were this nice to me
"This guy used to stop by my convenience store after work and pick up a couple tall boys of shit beer, I live in a beer town so I told him he should try some of the local stuff and then I sold it to him at the cheap beer prices, seemed like a couple bucks would have made a difference in his life."
"This went on for a couple months till one night my boss was doing something behind the counter when he checked out so I had to charge him the full prices, he got super mad at me like I was trying to rip him off then he never came back."
"All the other clerks were pocketing like 50 bucks a night so I didn't feel too bad about giving away a couple bucks here or there, I usually had a shift drink or two also."
Anyway that's the story of my first job.
"I had a 70 year old woman call me handsome  today , she is the first woman (including the last 2 relationships  I've had which totaled 10 years) to give me a compliment  ."
Made me feel decent for a few minutes .
"When I worked my warehouse job, I'd go by this 7/11 at like 1:30 every morning."
"And every morning the clerk would greet me with a ""hey buddy!"
"I fucking love that guy, he was working his ass off."
I hope everything worked out for him.
Having a regular gas station where 🎵everybody knows your name🎵 is actually pretty great.
When I go in half asleep before work for some cigs and caffeine it's like seeing a smiling group of your friends hyping you up for work.
It may be just business but it's great customer service.
"As a owner of a quick service restaurant, I absolutely love my regulars."
And what’s best is getting to know them.
"They tel me about their days, family’s, work, vacation."
"And once they trust me and the food I cook, they ask me just to make them something to eat."
It warms my heart.
Obviously we appreciate all of our customers but I do have a soft spot for my regulars.
Please don’t ever feel like “omg they’re gonna think I’m weird going again”.
It’ll make them smile really.
"Yeah that's nice and all, but maybe don't get gas station burritos and beer every day?"
"It’s wholesome, but it’s not a meme."
Just being objective.
"There's a halal gyro cart on my way home from work, or on my way to do errands, and the dude always yells to me by name and that dude is a sweetheart."
So what I'm getting at is that I eat too many gyro.
This dude is eating gas station burritos and drinking beer everyday.
I feel bad and am jealous both at the same time lol
Burrito in a gas station?
sign me up!
Somebody pulled that shit on me at Dunkin Donuts once and I've never gone back.
"I figured if I was going often enough that I'd been recognised and anticipated, I was going too often."
Now you're stuck with the guilt if you don't go one day.
I go to the same gas station a few times a week for beer.
One time I was pretty upset and ended up venting to the gas station attendant for about 10 minutes.
I came in the next day and told her she had really helped me.
I could see her holding back tears.
That surprised me a lot as I thought I was a burden the night before.
Now we're friends and have regular conversations everytime I come in.
I managed a gas station for 5 years.
"I had my regulars that I loved, they always had my back and knew when things were off."
I could trust them to watch the store for me to go pee really quick.
You would be surprised how much the little things mean to us.
"If you are a decent person and become a regular, you become like family."
If you go missing we feel genuine concern for you.
"Twice a week, I went to the same coffee shop on campus because they accepted dining dollars (I was a freshman and meal plans were mandatory) and got the same order: one 12 oz black coffee, the last time that I went, they had already started making it"
I go to Dunkin Donuts every Saturday and order the same thing.
"They are used to it now so usually as soon as I walk in they start making it, so I'm in and out in less than a minute."
That's some quality service right there!
This happened at subway I have a very.
Sandwich because of the choice of veggies and condiments.
Every Friday after school I’d go and get my sandwich.
Id always get greeted and they knew around the time I’d show up.
They always made my sandwich 10 minutes before I got in the store and they never got my order wrong.
"I wish I could get beer at my gas station, but I live in NJ :("
The relationship with your closest gas station guy is very important.
My guy lets me run up a tab and let me slide on cheap stuff like single beers and ramen from time to time.
We chit chat about soccer and he always wants me to hang out a bit longer.
I remember the first time he told me “hang out a bit longer man.
” And it kinda made me feel good like dang this dude actually enjoys my company and isn’t just pretending to be nice or polite.
His name is Aaron and he’s from India.
Jimmy from Portugal is there a lot too and he’s cool but I just feel like I’m better friends with Aaron.
We’re both big Arsenal fans.
My uncle lives alone and has heart problems.
Every Friday he orders food from the same Chinese delivery place.
He took a vacation and when he didn't place his regular order the restaurant called to make sure he was ok.
"There's a convenience store that's very, well."
convenient.
on my way home from work.
Stop there pretty much every day.
"Sometimes just for water, or a pack of batteries, some wine, whatever."
The other day I was there and checking out and the cashier just looked up at me and the guy behind me and said 'oh my gosh you're both here at the same time!
"'Apparently there's another guy that stops by every day, but we've never been there at the same time before."
There was an ongoing discussion among some of the employees about if we'd ever cross paths.
Daily beer and gas station burrito this guy should go get a check up
Being a regular anywhere is great.
I frequent a place ran by one lady and it's one of those places that kind of opens when it opens and closes when it closes.
"Doesnt matter how late I go in she'll make my order even when I say ""oh sorry I see you're packing up"" and go to leave she tells me to stay and takes my order."
She gives me free food sometimes too its awesome.
She got the city's  business of the month award this month Im so happy for her.
Holy shit thats a lot of karma for 1 post
Gas station burritos every day.
Way to treat yourself.
"That's literally the best thing ever, become besties then marry him."
I go to the same store for coffee and one night the cashier just gave it to me for free.
Chill dude
When I was in high school I went to Starbucks every day for my coffee.
after some time they were already preparing It as soon as I entered the coffee shop and even remembered that when it’s warm outside I drink iced coffee.
The only shit that made me survive high school
beer and gas station burritos everyday after work.
RIP toilet.
r/Canada
Beer and Burritos.
does sound pretty damned good!
That’s real cool.
He should totally hang with that guy.
Maybe play some video games together or go shooting.
Sounds like the start of a cool friendship.
Maybe putt-putt golf or he could suck his dick.
Yo is that Riley from Letterkenny haha
One of the McDonald's employee was like this with my coffee.
She knew what I out in it and would prepare it as soon as she'd see me in line.
I love her so much!
"Too bad I had to change my coffee habits, I don't get to have it every morning, sometimes I miss that gesture."
"Dude, your diet sucks!"
Beeritos
Beers and burritos every day.
I don't know if I should be jealous or worried.
2 Blue Red Bulls and a cinnamon bun for me.
Even the delivery guy for the cinnamon rolls knows me at this point.
Sometimes at a shitty service job reliable politeness can be exciting
"Attendant at my local 7-11 is always the sweetest guy, will chat with me about NFL, always tells everyone to have a blessed day."
"One day he was in a heated argument with a teen customer (my town calls them ""the wheelie gang"" bc they purposefully cause trouble on their bikes in traffic) and man if I didn't want to go total ""mom"" on that punk and drag him out of there by the ear when he told the attendant he was allowed to make and mess because it was attendant's job to clean it."
Argggg!
"Last I heard their ""gang"" is no longer allowed in without their parents."
This is the little bit that everyone is capable of doing.
Take care of each other out there.
Reminds me of my old job.
Cops would come by every night at 7pm\~.
"Each got a half chicken, side of rice provencal and broccoli."
Got to the point we always had fresh chickens for them ready to go.
"When you have regulars who are nice , you want to take care of them."
I've seen this post like 4 times over and I forget how much I love this each time and then remember I've seen this more and the cycle goes on.
"On the flip side of this, I once had a customer who was apparently ""a regular"" yell at me and file a complaint because I didn't have the right amount of hotdogs ready when he came in."
"At two in the afternoon, when the highschool across the street had just let out, and I'd worked there less than a month."
"I'd never seen this guy before in my life, let alone had any way of knowing who the fuck wants hotdogs."
"I had even started learning cigarettes to pull when I saw my real regulars come in, but I'd never seen this guy."
I don't know who the fuck he thought he was but I never saw him again and to this day I don't understand his indigence over fucking hotdogs.
I used to regularly fill up at the same gas station by paying cash inside and getting a pack of gum.
I did this regularly starting when I got a driver license in high school and almost always was with the same older cashier.
"Senior year I was supposed to be getting beer for some friends for a little kick back, and i decided to go to the gas station I frequent to try."
"I'm a big guy, look a bit order, came in to fill up, get a pack of gum, and a 36 pack of beer."
"The cashier looked at me, the beer, quickly around the store then rang me up."
Walked out with the beer and a friend giving me the 'how the fucking fuck?
' look.
"Pssh, my local bbq people are way better than that."
There's this food truck I go to a bunch and I get the brisket tacos every time.
They know my order and I just exchange pleasantries and pay every time.
A few weeks ago I'd had a rough day at work and got to the taco truck pretty late.
"Described my day to them, the cook without looking up just said 'this one's free'."
Made my goddamn week.
Turned a bad day into a great day.
Amazing tacos for free?
I paid them back by going three times in less than a week.
(and wrote a sick ass yelp review)
Everyone should have someone who makes them fresh burritos.
Or remembers what beer they’re getting.
Or knows to make them tea and leave them alone.
Whatever someone needs.
"Sometimes those are the simplest, but most important of our unmet needs — knowing someone has our back, knowing they think of us."
"If the dude who made you the burritos is not married, you should put a ring on it."
That is as it good as it gets.
Amirite?
"On my (short) ride into work, I got into the habit of going through the BK drive-in window and getting my Diet Coke for the morning."
"After several weeks of this, the manager was at the window."
"He handed it to me with a smile and said, “It’s on the house."
”  This happened almost once a week.
I felt seen and appreciated.
And he had a committed customer.
It really is those little connections people make with us during the day that mean the most.
"Not some grand overture, just thoughtful consideration."
Why is he eating burritos everyday?
I want to do that too actually.
Stories like this remind me that most people are genuinely awesome.
This gives me the warm fuzzies but I'm also amazed you eat gas station burritos daily.

Why is the baby even there.
"That moment before she follows through ""Long live the King"""

That’s on the mom.
The middle daughter heard her mom send her younger brother on an attack.
I love how the Mom is super supportive of her daughter riiiiiight up to the point she goes too far.

Wouldn’t want to be the random Chinese citizen on the street who is the perfect organ match for President Pooh if he needed one!
There are two Canadians in Chinese prison and the Canadian government has done nothing to get them out.
Anyone have a source besides a random picture?
Would like to learn more.
China is a totalitarian shithole.
Why do people always have to say friendly reminder before shit like this
is there a source for some of this?
who is saying they are executing people for their organs?
"Any evidence of raping, being used as medical guinea, sterilising?"
"The paper referenced under the top comment is just a preliminary research, it's not actually applied."
"Many papers have been published on cancer curing medicine, but none of them is actually manufactured."
"This is because most of the researches are just a proof of concept study, trying to see what we can do with technology."
"However most of them fails, never meet the market."
You can't use this as an evidence that China is torturing the minorities.
People don't think we're being brainwashed with propaganda - that's good for a laugh.
yes Muslims  Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims
And the Nba /blizzard don't seem to care
Source for these claims?
Not against it just want some hard evidence not a Reddit headline
Not trying to be a wise guy here but how exactly do we know what is happening in those camps?
"Do we have videos, pictures, eye witnessess etc andif so are those available somewhere to digest?"
Anybody has a proof?
i'm genuinely curious how much truth there is to these reports.
"where do we get those numbers and how do we know those people are being ""raped, humiliated, used as medical guinea pigs, sterilised, and executed for their organs""."
honestly the way the post is worded seems to me as if a narrative is being pushed at the same such rumours gotta have some truth to them and they can't exist in a void.
"Ok this is starting to sound very ""third world war""-y"
"*“Never again”* became the mantra after the WW2 holocaust, yet here we are."
"Instead of watching Gypsies, Jews and gays being systematically oppressed, tortured or killed by Germany, it’s now China’s turn to eradicate non-Han ethnicities and political opponents."
"Oh right, it’s kind of different this time because China is also a great business opportunity."
"I always love a good ""friendly reminder of propaganda"" via propaganda and an image"
This post itself is a propaganda.
">communist propagandaif you actually think china is communist, holy shit your education has failed you"
Why isn't the entire western world embargoing china for shitoh right.
"Post about Chinese concentration camps and about an hour in, most comments, including the OP are about America."
Money moves the world.
We have sold our souls.
Hitler would win today because no one would want to upset the stocks.
How sad for humanity it didn’t take an epic event but a slavery of currency.
China communist?
"Really, dude?"
At this point in time are you going to call that country communist?
"""tortured, raped, humiliated, used as medical guinea pigs, sterilised, and executed for their organs""You got a source for that?"
"I heard of the brainwashing, which seems to be a pretty racist thing (they claim to need to get rid of radical-islamic thoughts), but the rest afaik seems to be just the typical internet bs."
"It's true, they're the Uyghur Muslims."
And that is one of the main reasons why China is so quiet on the whole Kashmir issue regarding India ( China overwhelmingly supports Pakistan due to their strategic economic corridor.
I don’t care what China does and am not willing to sacrifice a single American to stop them.
If you feel strongly about it then buy a ticket to Hong Kong and lay down your own life for the cause.
My son isn’t going to be used as a pawn so you can sleep better at night
The 8 people on r/sino think you're all big fat western meanies.
IIRC these camps are equivalent of propoganda school where people go in and leave at the end of the day.
OP describes it like a Holocaust-like scenario.
"If people were systematically being killed like that, we'd fucking know."
Spreading fake news won't liberate Hong Kong/weaken the grip of the CCP.
We house more inmates than any country on earth based on our population.
And many of those things happen in our prisons everyday.
Where was your outage about this before?
"Wow, the american bots have been out in force in the last couple of weeks!"
Don't you get it you stupid cocksuckers?
The world runs on Chinese made bullshit.
We're all complicit in this nonsense.
"I'm sure everyone commenting here has a car and house made or filled with Chinese made bullshit, and I'm sure they'll be buying some more tomorrow."
My point?
"I know I'm an asshole, but I love to see so many other smug pieces of shit pretending like their assholes don't stink, and Just like the noisy fuck sticks complaining about climate change who make little to no changes in their countless habits that make them complicit in the problem, I see this as a whole lot more bullshit from sheltered, entitled assholes who like to pretend to be virtuous on the internet, meanwhile, they're just another selfish jerk-off like every other mass-minded, thoughtless motherfucker out there."
Go fuck yourselves.
&#x200B;PS - I see at least one person upvoted me.
"Thanks for the upvote, asshole."
Please learn more about these camps and spread the word.
The Uighur community has said that they are waiting for the world to take notice.
"This is large scale, state-sanctioned genocide."
Wait lists for organ replacement in China are ~1 week.
The existence of these camps and the iron-grip lockdown of Xinjiang is a nightmare for millions of innocent families.
They are powerless to do anything as their friends and loved ones are kidnapped and never heard from again.
Please do what you can to bring attention to this story.
This is why a boycott against Blizzard should last a lot longer than just a few days.
Companies that bend the knee to China deserve death.
Also a friendly reminder that the whole world knows and wont do shit because China is a very important business partner.

I feel bad they have to go to such measures to fight for their way of life.
It's almost as if people inherently detest being tracked by their government or something.

This chimp considers this human a superior in hierarchy and holds his hand from under to show so.

]  Similar palm-up signals have been studied in great apes.
Chimpanzees (Pan paniscus and P.
"troglodytes) use palm-up signs to beg for food, invite bodily contact, and request aid during conflicts with other chimps."
The fist bump at the end killed me
No tail broHe an ape
[deleted]
Man he must’ve  developed a very strong relationship with this guy in order to do that.
I always think of that woman on the east coast who had her face ripped off.
gives you kind of a reality check when working with these animals
ChimpanzeeBro

"Ape, not monkey 🙊"
Chimpanzees are on another level when it comes to strength
"Jaime, pull that vid up of the guy getting lifted by the chimp"
I was awwwing until the fist bump.
That part was awesome 😂
Chimpanzees are not monkeys.
That's adorable.
I don't know how videos like this can exist and there are still people who don't believe in the truth of evolution.
"That is a video of two incredibly intelligent, incredibly dextrous animals that are barely any different than one another."
It is absolutely stunning how similar chimps are to human beings and how well they seem to understand how we try to communicate with them.
Not monkey.
Monkeys have tails.
Cool vid tho.
don't let the librarian hear you call an ape a monkey
"“Jamie, pull up that video of that one dude fist bumping that chimp."
"yeah, that one, no, scroll up, yeah — watch this” ."
“you see that?
Fuuuuck!
"What are you doing, man?"
That thing could rip you face right off!
One swoop.
That’s all it takes.
It’s a killing machine.
Seriously.
"No, for real, you ever seen that photo of the shaved ape?"
"Jamie, Jamie pull up that picture of the shaved ape”."
That's a chimpanzee which is a primate and a member of the great apes (as are we).
We share ~95-98% of our DNA with chimpanzees.
"Other great apes include: gorillas, bonobos, gibbons, humans, and orangutans."
"We are larger in size, lack tails, have larger brains, and are among the most intelligent creatures on the planet."
We are all genetically and morphologically VERY similar.
"Monkeys are also primates, but are more distantly related."
"They tend to be smaller, have tails, and correspondingly smaller brains."
"Just want to make that distinction: monkeys and apes are both primates, but they are otherwise very different."
Edit: forgot an Oxford comma.
This the start of the planet of the apes
"Honestly, either that camera work was really impressive, or the chimpanzee was really strong."
or both.
"Actually, I really just wanna see how this was filmed."
it's like too steady
The look in his eyes.
so kind.
"Chimps are scary as fuck, build like a tank and can rip anyone to shreds"
"Jamie, pull up some videos of chimps helping people out."
That fist bump though.
That ape's name is Sugriva and the guy is Kody Antle.
Check out his Instagram @kodyantle
Monkeys are insanely strong.
The way he scaled that with ease blows my mind.
Umm this is amazing
The fucking fist bump at the end 😭
Stronk boi
#OH MY GOD I WANT ONEbut not really.
They’re too special to be held captive.
Going from 1 hand to 2 hands is awesome
That lion in the background
It’s insane how strong they are.
That was nothing to him and there was hardly any leverage either.
"no tail, not monkey"
aaaw how gently he holds that humans hand to lift him up
That fistbump at the end got me good
I love the connection between apes and humans.
"I feel like ""owning"" an ape makes you feel more like equals"
Damn.
"Knowing how insanely strong and dangerous chimps can be, it’s amazing how *careful* this one is helping this guy up."
"Like, “I got you, bro."
"You may be taller, but I’ll be the muscles."
Apes together strong
r/animalsbeingbros
Awe I want to hold a chimps hand
This is the best.
That fist bump tho
Damn.
that's got to be the coolest fistbump I've seen!
"This will probably get buried at this point, but these videos showing full contact between chimps and humans are bad for several reason."
I work with chimpanzees for a living.
"This facility, Myrtle Beach Safari, is always posting this shit."
The Antle family does nothing for conservation and only hurt chimps in the long run by perpetuating unsafe practices.
"Their animals were not ""abandoned by their mothers."
""" In many cases their mothers were killed and babies sold to places like this."

This might be the best gif on the internet
Chimps are scary yet adorable at the same time
This reminds me of being kidnapped and held hostage by a wild orangutan in Sumatra.
My guide had to give her fruit to release me but as Jackie the orangutan pulled me deeper into the forest she was always holding my hand and guiding me along.
I remember a push on the ass to help get me over a huge fallen log.

That’s one funky monkey
Just look at how delicately he grabs his wrist.
I woke up about ten minute ago.
This video made my whole day.
yo props to that monkey for helpin this dude out

Be forewarned that nothing else will be as good as this photo.
She has peaked
I love this so hard.
The derpy half smile is totally what makes this photo.
I can’t stop laughing picturing her with the left facial expression in a top hat and monocle like an old time-y villain
[Needed some lasers.

"From ""I dont think that was a fart"" to ""I am you supreme Lord ruler"""

she looks high af.
"Solid lighting, what’s your setup?"
Ahh this is awesome.
Made me laugh.
Haven’t slept properly in weeks rarely anything brings me joy now thank you op
How did you do this and could you do it for me?
My bfs cat not me lol
When are you free?
"Okay, I have to know: how did you isolate the whiskers on the foreground layer so cleanly?"
Nice!
"Hey real quick, what are these types of photos called?"
It’s a serious question.
I can’t seem to describe it well enough for Google to return relevant results.
Is it some type of superimposed thing?
If I send you my cat can you make one of these and send him back?
A majestic derp
You're an amazing friend
You’re the best kind of friend.
My favorite part of this post is finding more pictures in OP's comment replies
"I was inspired by this post, and I decided to make my own."
What are your rates?
This is glorious.
You have no idea how much I want this for my cat.
awkwardfamilyphotos.
I would love one of these for my cat so I can frame and hang it lol
If you imagine the pics as two separate sith lords it’s pretty funny:*Two there should be.

No joke.
I think you’re friends with my best friend because this exact photo was just on her IG story this afternoon!

That’s not even my cat but I want it framed and on my mantle
This is one of my favorite things on the internet.

This is literally the best thing I have seen in my entire life.
Thanks for my new phone wallpaper!
This is now my phone wallpaper.
Sorry not sorry.
This snarky-ass cat better be solving mysteries for his local bodega in cartoon form for our enjoyment.
Tell me the truth.
The cat made you do this right?
"This just made my day better, thank you friend"
It's so high quality
I can hear it doing the *chk chk* sound he does in Fantastic Mr Fox
Is that cat running for political office?
Any candidate with such a dignified portrait deserves my vote.

Holy hell this is the greatest thing I've seen all week.
I had to save this
Please babysit my cat next.
Kitty nailed their school photo

Any way you'd give me a brief rundown as to how you did this?
I have to do it for my cat.

This sounds stupid but I’ve been desperately trying to find someone to do this picture but of me.
I didn't knew you could even baby sit a Cat.
A Dog?
Perhaps.
But a Cat?
Thats new.

I like that it looks a little like the cat is the leader of a communist party.
Can I please turn this into a meme?
I dislike cats and anything cat related but this is fucking great !
How did you do this?
Did you use photoshop?
I’d love to do this with my derpy dog
"Is there an app I can use to take pictures like this, or do I have to know how to use Photoshop and all that"
What is this style of photo called
I wish you were nearby so you could take photos of my two morons!
My friend did this nearly 20 years ago when watching my kitties and dog.
Now that I’ve lost my fur babies I’m so grateful for the pics.
He looks like a kid who’s mom just told him to smile for the camera.
This post once more proves that the single purpose of cats is to break the internet (and push shit off tables)
Where’s the one of her on the Purina cat food bag?
Loved it.
This photo is amazing!
they are so pretty and fierce i’m jealous
He just needs a mullet.
The little sneersmirk.

Why does the cat in the back look like its gonna take a shit in my shoe for not giving it treats?
Nice lighting
Great job
Omg that face!
I love this sooo much.

You are the best friend anyone could ever ask for.
"You are an excellent friend, caretaker and payer of pettaxes!"
You did good.
I’m proud of you.
Amazing.
Oh yes
Her face in the bottom is so r/youseeingthisshit
It’s what every true friend should do.
Now you just need to have it printed and framed and leave it in their house without saying anything
If she hasn't seen it you need to replace one of the photos in her house without her knowing.
Before and after drugs
I love everything about this.
Aw that face tho !

Right: That face you make when you see your human take the gifts you have bestowed upon them in the litter tray.
Glorious.
That’s awesome!
Does she let you pet them ?
If I don’t see these ducks splashing around in a baby pool within the next few days I’m gonna be very disappointed OP
"on the way there she was saying ""i can't wait for you guys to meet my good friend, we go back years"""
So what you’re saying is.
the mama duck scored herself some free daycare through her adorable babies?
Good haul this year!
Please post updates 😊
Do you start to anxious every year waiting for her arrival?
"**Mother Duck:** ""You know the drill, human""."
How does one gain the trust of so many quackers?
How did this get started?
Do you consider yourself the grandma of sorts?
"Are you actually a human sized duck, OP?"
At my old house a family of fucks would roost every year.
I even made them a duck house.
Sometimes they would peck on the door for me to come out and give them seedsEdit: I have a pic of the fuck house.
Can someone tell me how to post it?
Edit 2: thanks to u/oodie1127 (and others) for the tips.
If you zoom in on the momma beak it looks like a snake in a duck costume once you zoom back out
"I always gave my ducky neighbors oats so they knew that whenever I went out back they were getting fed, and lots of mamas-to-be would nest nearby to get access to the buffet!"
"At the demands of my family I stopped feeding them for a month or two because they kept pooping on the porch, but there was a significant decrease in the survival rates of new chicks—oats contain niacin, a necessary vitamin for ducks that helps them thrive."
After burying so many of the deceased ducklings I snubbed my family’s wishes and got them more oats.
Thank you for being another honorary ducky grandparent!
That’s awesome?
How did this start?
"That is adorable, and a Bakers Dozen no less!"
You are Natures friend it seems.
How long has she been doing this and do have more pics of the fluff balls?
Are you Tony Soprano?
"I was looking at your older posts and, when I grow up, I want to be you."
So I wonder if when the ducklings are older will the mommas remember your house and try to nest there?
Remindme 1-2 years
"So wait, does she literally just show up at your doorsteps and knock on your door?"

I love the ducks!
She's outsourcing care.
"Life's hard these days for a single mother with 13 kids, you know?"
I'm raising a muscovy right now too.
We live on a lake and one day I saw a large male adult muscovy attacking a tiny duckling.
"He was trying to drown it, holding it under water."
So I scared it away and the duckling came right to me.
Never saw a mommy or other babies so not sure where it came from.
"We kept it on our porch for a few weeks, feeding it duck food until it was big enough to roam around safely outside."
Still not sure if its a male or female because it still 'talks'.
I read that at a certain age all male muscovies lose the ability to quack/chirp.
I'm guessing it's roughly 6-8 weeks now based off how long we've had it and how small it was when we saved it.
It's crazy how fast they grow.
It's nearly the size of an adult now and full of feathers.
"I named it Bubbles, because it survived the drowning attempt."
How sweet!
I hope they all survive.
What do you feed them?
/u/fuckswithducks might be a little jealous.
"I see a duck, I upvote"
"Fun fact, depending on how many years this has been going on, this may in fact be a multigenerational learned ability."
"You see the young females return to where they hatched, figuring that they too will get off a successful hatch."
You may very well be seeing multi generations come thru.
"""Hey look, I got knocked up again."
help a Duck out?
"If 13 ducks showed up at my door I'd call them Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur and Thorin."
She has definately adopted a few other clutches lol.
"Fun facts: These birds are like dogs, they will beg for food, even catch it if you teach them by dropping it at their begging mouths."
They will wag their tails and follow you around like puppies if you raise them.
They are a species known as Muscoveys despite people calling them Muscovey Ducks.
They are a tree bird native only to the western hemisphere.
"When bred with a true duck, they produce mules which will be infertile."
"They have no quack/call, but a hollow chortle and a hoarse hissing sound."
"They are extremely friendly and learn easily, just don't tease them like you are going to offer them food if you have no intention, as they will bite the hand that doesn't feed it."
Congratulations on your newest grand-ducklings!
How did you make friends with the duck?
do ducks like to be petted?
I fed some geese canned corn at the park last month and one bit me 3 times.
Then it chased me to my car and tried getting into the car.
I'm guessing it wanted to bite me again.
Keep this up and in 20 years you’ll have a fine duck army
Can you give her my address for the holidays?
Whats it like being a foster parent?
"I’m sure amazon has duck costumes, you could be grandma duck in no time."
"For the love of God don't count them again everyday or week, you'll be very sad."
So cute.
until they start shitting all over the place
I love this!
I was wondering how long they normally stick around for?
Do you name them?
Do you have a name for the mom?
"Also, do you ever see the babies after they leave?"
My heart can’t take this!
Are you Snow White?
"My sister has some regulars each year, Mr&Mrs Quack and babies."
We live in a UK housing Estate with the nearest river about half a mile away.
Every year they come back.
"She is like Doctor Doolitle though, looks after hedgehogs and foxes."
Rescued a rat and took it to the nearby racecourse to let it free.
Nurses damaged pigeons etc.
I'm going to need approximately all the footage you have of these little fuzzballs
I had one in my flower bed sitting on its eggs in April.
I didnt actually know it was there until my 3 year old daughter sat down next to it too closely and it bit her ear lol.
"The ducklings hatched in May, two days after my son was born, had to open the gate to my back yard for 13 little puffballs and their mother."
I had a duck do this that I named Ronald.
"Then one day he, or so I thought, brought a few ducklings by and I realized Ronald was actually a Rhonda."
Why are some solid yellow and some black and yellow?
Does it indicate gender or is it just due to random genetics?
I just have to share my new baby boy Penpen.
You might want to contact Disney for an official recognition that you are a Princess.
This is fascinating!
Do you know how/why she decided to come to your house?
I live on a farm and we have a family of ducks on our dam.
There are reeds at the back of the dam which are perfect for the ducks making their nest.
"They don’t come up to our house, but we see them every day either on the dam or wandering around foraging on the farm."
"I counted 6 when I purchased the farm 13 years ago, but now there is well over a dozen."
"They are quite use to us however we have to drive past the dam to get out the gate, and sometimes they will block the driveway as if to say, ‘ how dare you drive past our dam’."
We just get out of the car and shoo them off the driveway much to their protest.
I want your life.
I wish my life was this cool
I had no idea they could have so many ducklings!
Is it possible to learn this power?
This reminds me of a mama duck that use to raise her babies in my highschools court yard.
She returned every year while I was in school and i like to hope she still goes there now!
Best part was once they were old enough to leave the school would close down a hallway and open the doors so they could safely walk through the school exit into the outside world.
so fucking cute
We need more pictures!
"A mama duck once made her nest under our front bush, and I’d go out there and check on her and the eggs every day."
"We went away for the weekend, and sure enough, when we got back, there was nothing but broken shells."
I was so disappointed.
"A few days later, I pulled into my driveway after work, looked to my left, and saw a mama duck walking right thru my lawn, with a line of babies behind her."
"I was so moved, I nearly cried."
It felt like mama had come back to show me.
It’s still one of my “God is real” moments.
omg thats awsome you are  like a duck whisperer
I wonder if when the ducklings grow up they’ll do the same 🤔
Please never move houses
"I would demand duckternity testing, I have a feeling you are NOT the father, and shouldn’t have to pay duckling-support for someone else!"
Hey OP you appreciate you and what you do
This is freakin awesome.
"Serious question, what motherly ducky duties do you assist her with?"
"I have 2 rescue muscovy ducks and they are so sweet, I hand feed my girls spinach and they go crazy for it, you just can't give them lots of it"
Smart mama duck
"""Take."
Them.
oh my god.
the duck has a nanny.
You're so lucky.
I love ducks.
"So are you saying, half of them are yours?"
"Every year, my sister-in-law does the same thing to me."
Much less cute.
You realize you can never move now right?
Like.
you have to stay in that house forever
Is she leaving them with you to go out partying all night though?
Muscovy ducks.
They are non-native.
In some states they are considered an invasive species.
This is adorable.
My pups would have a cow!
Tony would be so happy!
This is so incredible!
Thank you for sharing it!
You're an amazing person 💖
I used to live next to a stream and this one duck would come up every year and lay her eggs in one of our bushes.
She’d let us get close to her and her eggs and we’d feed her.
Whoever runs next time has a hell of a slogan:Hindsight is 20/20.
Let's not forget that having a first past the post voting system gave us this mess.
Fuck the DNC and the RNC but also fuck the system that keeps them in power.
"Bernie practically had all the independents, but the DNC just had to have its golden girl as the candidate."
And now all the advances we made on the liberal platform went to hell.
"I said 8 years ago when Obama was running against Hillary in the primaries that if the Dems make Hillary the nominee, republicans could literally nominate a plank of wood and it would best her."
This is the result of the massive hatred republicans have for Clinton.
This is their fault for letting her take this from Bernie sanders.
"I still remember people shitting on Bernie while he was still in, saying Hill was obviously the better option."
WHERE YOU AT NOW YOU FUCKS.
[deleted]
Conservative here.
My sympathies.
We differ in beliefs but he seemed like a genuine candidate.
"My overall opinion of Bernie aside, I 100% think it would have been a different game with him in there."
It's a shame how the media and the DNC treated him.
Good job Shillary.
Good job Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
Good job rigging the election you fucks.
"Any other candidate would have been the easiest win in the history of America, but you forced a candidate down our throats."
"Good job, DNC."
You played yourselves and fucked us all.
You enormous pieces of shit.
Those fucking idiots at the DNC who rigged it is the reason Hillary lost.
"They chose the weaker candidate, and they deserve to lose because of their corruption and shitty choices."
Fuck the DNC.
Idiots.
This is what happens when you rig your primary.
DNC is full of a bunch of fucking idiots.
"They even had the media push for Trump during the primary as a ""pied piper"" candidate so Clinton could win easier."
Look how that turned out.
Fuck them.
The blame should be on their shoulders.
"If Hillary loses, she has to go down as the worst Presidential candidate ever, simply because she lost to an absolute trainwreck in Trump."
"Clearly it wasn't ""Hillarys turn"" like the DNC wanted."
"I voted Bernie in the primary, it ain't my fucking fault."
Exactly fucking this.
"I remember early on during the primaries how god damn stuck up the Hillary4President crowd were, talking shit and saying how they didn't want ""BernieBros"" to vote for their candidate."
There you fucking had it DNC.
"Stealing the primary ~ rigging it against Bernie, having superdelegates commit before any debating happened, having NewYorks need to register 6 months before debates started to vote in the primary."
Donna Brazil colluding with clinton.
"Their camp should have told Donna to get fucked and said ""We are too proud to try and steal this."
""" Taking Wasserman Schultz onto the clinton camp."
FUCK YOU.
God i'm so angry right now I'm not even speaking straight.
"Smug clinton assholes have fucked the people for months and now they are about to reap the damn consequences, and we are all going to suffer because of it."
"Republicans abhor Clinton, her history, and all that she stands for."
As a Democrat who voted for her today I still do not have an ounce of respect for her.
"She has done very little to account for her negative image, focusing on superficial pandering instead."
I truly feel as though Bernie's charisma and genuine empathy for the American people could have coaxed Republican voters to think differently.
I think tomorrow's America could have been something amazing.
"From someone who was inspired by Bernie enough to donate and volunteer for a Presidential candidate for the first time in life: Fuck you, DNC."
"Fuck you, DWS."
You have no one to blame but your primary-rigging selves.
Hillary wanted to win so badly she bet the entire country on it.
Bernie was the best shot we had but her greed was greater than her interest in the American people.
"Not only did the DNC stack the odds in the primary against Bernie, [they actively worked towards getting Trump the Republican nomination."
reddit.
Time for a new progressive party!
"People don't like fake primaries, who knew?"
"As a Bernie supporter, the only satisfaction I get from Trump winning is the despair of Hillary, the DNC, and Debbie wasserman Schultz."
"You fucking stupid cunts, this is all your fault."
The DNC shot themselves in the foot when they didn't put up Bernie Sanders like the American people wanted.
Sander's would have won by a land slide against Trump.
The fools at the DNC wanted Clinton and got her and lost bad for it.
"If they ever try this again, they will likely create a new third party over it."
I'm really feeling the Bern right now 😭😭😭
Everyone in the DNC need to resign.
Fucking corrupt asses
reddit.
"It's accompanied by cries of ""I'm with her"" and ""It's her turn"" while ignoring the entirety of disenfranchised Americans on the left AND the right."
"There was a perfectly good candidate - one that was not only favored to win tonight, but also who still has incredible approval ratings - better than that of either of the two running today."
"We just wanted you to feel the Bern, but instead you're burning mad."
DNC - listen up: You fucked up.
You fucked up really good.
You ignored the people while trying to pay back favors by building a corrupt dynasty.
"You took the second most universally hated candidate, and served him a win on a silver platter by betting on the #1 most universally hated candidate."
TRUMP SUPPORTERS: Send Debbie Wasserman Schultz a gift basket tomorrow.
Too bad Hillary stole his ball just to miss the game winning shot.
~~Maybe.
I don't know yet for sure.
I love how the DNC rigged the primary against Bernie to put a weaker candidate in place which then shoots the party in its own fucking foot this is infuriating I cannot believe this
I feel like Bernie was the only one of the candidates that actually cared about the people and the country.

DNC with the most monumental fuck up in democratic history.
FUCK YOU DNC AND FUCK YOUR BULLSHIT.
SHOULDN'T HAVE CHEATED BERNIE OUT OF THE PRESIDENCY ASSHOLES.
The Republicans went with a candidate who-- for better or worse-- represented the values of their base.
The Democrats sabotaged their base's candidate and offered a robot in his stead.
The finger has to be squarely pointed at the DNC if Trump wins.
"On the bright side, the Clinton dynasty is completely and utterly done."
"I voted bernie in the primary, and hillary in the general."
so this is all not my fault!
"But now we lose Bernie a second time, this time as a budget affairs head guy."
Bernie would not have lost Michigan or Wisconsin.
End of story.
This happens if you rig everything in favor of the UNELECTABLE candidate.
Hillary stole it from him.
Fucking bullshit.
[deleted]
Hillary Clinton killed the Democrat Party
We would have loved Bernie.
"Sincerely, Cacanada"
This is 100% on the DNC.
"They fucked over the Bernie campaign and hired thugs to harass their supporters online (C T R), and they expect those same people to come out and vote for Hillary?"
[deleted]
"I'll probably be sorry and delete this post in the morning since I'm drunk but, what exactly did the DNC expect?"
This is what happens when both candidates are equally as bad as each other but only one party screwed over their own voters.
I had no horse in this race.
My horse was shot at the gate and I got to vote independent in a relatively safe democratic state.
To the DNC I can only say this: get fucked!
You reap what you sowed.
"Any Canadian brothers out there, looking to help out an american ""wife,"" hit me up on craigslist on wednesday, lol."
The DNC was against him from day 1 what a shame.
Bernie vs Ted would have been a much more meaningful race.
Stupid fucking Hillary was SOOO ENTITLED to the presidency that she fucked over Bernie.
Stole the nom from him.
And now she's upset the fucking natural balance.
She was always going to lose.
But she was supposed to lose to The Bern.
Who was going to beat Trump.
Now she's lost to Trump.
Fuck.
Bernie was the first real politician in a long time who wore his heart on his sleeve.
"You could tell he loved his country so much, that he knew he had to be honest about what he believed in, and which direction he would have steered the US had he been elected as president."
"On the flip side, Hillary won the primary, and was a clay candidate who would shape herself, and say, anything she needed to win."
"Leaders are honest about their own convictions, and they stand up for their own beliefs, even when it's against the grain."
Here's to Bernie 2020.
"There will be a Republican White House, a Republican Senate, a Republican House, and a Republican Supreme Court."
Because Democrats allowed a woman to cheat her way into the nomination.
"She didn't win 8 years ago, and she wasn't going to win this year."
You screwed the man that would of buried Trump during this election.
"This is a self-inflicted consequence brought to you by Independents who watched you let Hillary commit fraud, rig the primaries, and spit on democracy and our constitution."
Let it all BERN!
Absofukinglutely.
So pissed right now.
Fuck you Hillary and Fuck you DNC - you did this.
This is sad.
"Trump will win not because of Hillary, but because the DNC was perceived to be deaf to the voices of its constituents."
Bernie would have locked this up already.
blame the dnc and hillary
The DNC may have just put 4 conservative supreme court justices on the bench.
"Congrats, corporations may have more rights than breathing human beings before this is over."
what ever over turns out to be.
Sanders would have walked all over Trump.
It's too soon to call it but Trump has a pretty serious lead right now and this is the fault of the neo-liberal DLC shitbags that have taken over the DNC.
Hahahahahahahahaha cuck'd
If he could keel over and die that would be much appreciated
YES IT SHOULDVE.
"The DNC, Hillary's team got too cocky to think they had in the bag, now take a look at whats happening."
Hillary has nobody to blame but herself.
Her hubris has irreparably damaged the Democratic party.
You know what?
I was salty when Bernie lost to a degree.
But now that for certain that Clinton is doomed thanks to the DNC's buffoonery and due to that Trump is going to be in the big house.
it just makes me angry.
It frustrates me.
Bernie probably would've won.
It makes me upset because of among the great names I respect so dearly in the presidential halls.
the fact that I have to add Donald Trump to that list.
I've got no words.
This honestly upsets me so much.
Bernie didn't deserve to be treated the way he did.
Most promising candidate in generations and DNC denied his chance to make a difference.
Let the dnc hear our message loud and clear:We will *NOT* have a candidate shoved down our throats!
imgur.
I agree.
"If it had been Bernie Sanders, he would be president elect by now."
"The press called him a kook, and his party stabbed him in the back."
People want change.
Not more of politicians.
They want an outsider.
Make them pay!
Rebuild the DNC from the ground up.
"Really, Michigan and Wisconsin cost $hillary the election."
"I voted for her (in the general only), but her rap sheet of corruption is 100 pages long."
Bernie's (non bullshit) stance on TPP would have easily won him Michigan and Wisconsin.
Hillary more electable?
"Eat your words, Hillary primary voters."
Like I said back then .
a vote for Hillary in the primaries was a vote for President Trump.
Fuck sake.
Now you realize .
The DNC is to blame if Trump wins.
This post is only 3 hours old.
Why is it no longer on the front page when there are posts 16 hours old on there and this has twice the upvotes of any other post.
Pics showing the Front page before and after its removal.
The salt mines of reddit will never be depleted
I hope the DNC feels like a bitch after all they did to screw Bernie.
Fuck the DNC
I feel really bad for you Americans right now.
"Take care, guys."
This is what happens when a party rigs a primary.
why is this removed from the frontpage?
"Yes, it should have."
We all knew it.
I warned people after the primaries.
Clinton supporters told me it was otherwise and that Clinton would have no trouble taking on Trump.
"I knew that was wrong, and now that's proved to be the case."
This is a lesson that the Democratic establishment will not soon forget.
He would have lost too ;)
youtube.
I would have swallowed the HRC pill if they didn't rig the DNC Primary.
I donated money to bernie in an unfair contest.
Fuck the Clintons
"As a conservative, i would've voted for Bernie."
He was the only candidate that I felt truly wanted to be president to make things better.
I may not have agreed with his take on how to run our country but I would've trusted him.

Nothing fishy here at all.
Thank god it wasnt
FUCK CORRUPT POLITICIANS.
FUCK THIS COUNTRY.
SHITTY PIECE OF GARBAGE.
FUCK HILLARY.
PAPA BERNIE SHOULD HAVE SAVED US.
I'M SO SAD.
fuck the dnc
What's going on is fruit of the DNC fuck up.
The fact that they put the most corrupt and worthless candidate to represent them.
and sabotaged the democratic process with rigged primaries and insiders giving that corrupt bitch questions before the debates.
"it all came to light but too many motherfuckers put their fingers in their ears and yelled ""lalalalala trump is worse"" as if this makes this warmongering POS any better."
"They had their opportunity with Bernie but they pushed the narrative ""he's too controversial, he's unelectable, his ideas are too extreme""."
well guess what motherfuckers that's what the people have been asking for and now you're getting it but not in the form you wanted
"This was on the front page with OVER 24,000 UPVOTES."
"**how in the hell did it get down to 13,800 something and OFF the frontpage?"
**---
"This exact post had over 20000 ups last night, now down to 5000."
Hmmmm.
"Wow, 24 gold for posting up a picture."
not bad!
"Bernie, the ""socialist"" (commie) that preaches about solidarity and then pays 13% in income tax and that after the election bought another multi-million house."
Where does all the money come from if he lives as he preaches?
I have not detected any talents or that he has been a business owner.
All this is easy if you use your brain.
You do not even have to be smart.
"For those saying a vote for (anyone not Hillary Clinton) is a vote for Trump:If we're going to play that game, I would argue that a vote for Hillary during the primaries was a vote for Trump."
Bernie would have destroyed Trump in the general election.
The Democratic Party fucked themselves by doing what they did to Bernie.
They forced their agenda instead of nominating Bernie and this is what happens.
Bernie could have beaten trump.
"She couldn't win a primary without rampant collusion and cheating, I wonder why the DNC thought she could win the general, especially after spitting on all the progressives."
"I wish we had gotten that debate, even if he's not a perfect mainstream candidate, Bernie is a really good debater and could have embarassed Trump"
I still Feel the Bern
"I knew it, i kinda called the Democrats on this, Bernie would've easily won against Trump."
Democrats fucked themselves in the ass kinda.
"20,917 points with *68%* upvotes."
Goddamn.
"Why did this go from 25,000 upvotes / 66% upvoted down to 9,709 upvotes / 69% upvoted?"
You know this post was at 22 thousand last night.
Bernie would've crushed the rust belt so hard .
He would've crushed Trump so hard.
"Except  ""it's her turn"" blah blah blah."
People literally voted for trump to vote against Hillary--they wouldn't do that with Bernie on the ballot.
The establishment chose to ignore the passion Bernie instilled in people and the people still spoke--by choosing an orange lunatic.
DNC did this unto itself except we are all fucked.
wtf happened to this thread?
"it was sitting on like 25K upvotes, then dissapeared off front page now only had 4K"
"I do not like Trump, we should keep Obama!"
"You did this Clinton, Bernie would've beaten Trump."
"The main German news programme (Tagesschau) just described it as ""the biggest set of data journalists have ever laid hands on""."
"(Given that a German newspaper received the documents first and did most of the groundwork (which OP has just linked to), I guess it was published at 8pm CEST to coincide with the main Tagesschau broadcast of the day."
"Christ> In the past 12 months, around 400 journalists from more than 100 media organizations in over 80 countries have taken part in researching the documents."
Great to see a real score for investigative journalism here.

Ohhhh boy.
"From the live thread:>The Editor in Chief of Süddeutsche Zeitung responded to the lack of United States individuals in the documents, saying to ""Just wait for what is coming next""."
Dis gon be good.
"The article doesn't say it, but the  *folder* IS the shell company."
One file cabinet can hold hundreds of companies.
There's no waiting room for these companies.
No office.
No manned phone.
Nothing.
Only that folder and its contents.
The tangible part of a shell company weighs less than a ream of copy paper.
The intangible part of the company is massive.
>Mossack Fonseca created a folder for each shell firm.
"Each folder contains e-mails, contracts, transcripts, and scanned documents."
"In some instances, there are several thousand pages of documentation."
"From the ""About the Panama Papers"" section on the site, in case you want a quick summary: ""Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world."
"These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady."
"In the months that followed, the number of documents continued to grow far beyond the original leak."
"Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2."
"6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with."
"The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures."
The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows.
"It proves how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of the world’s rich and famous: from politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes."
Everything is going crazy in Iceland because of the scale of our role in this huge leak compared to our size in the world.
The PM is heavily criticized for these corrupt actions and people are already calling for him to resign.
There have always been a few rich and powerful corrupt individuals in Iceland and now they're finally getting exposed so I hope that will make a change in our government and other high ranking people.
Only thing i'm scared about is the image of Iceland being ruined just like in the 2008 banking crisis and the volcanic eruption in Eyjafjallajökull in 2010.
Edit: There will be held protests in front of the Icelandic parliament at 17:00 UTC local time (19:00 CEST).
"It looks like a few thousand people are attending the protests, including me."
Venezuelan here.
I'm my country right now there's a whole movement with this leak.
armando.
Things like members of the military opening accounts in Seychelles four days after Maduro's election victory and the boss of Venezuela's interpol being a drug trafficker.
This could have a deep impact here considering we are right now on an almost humanitarian crisis in which people are dying from preventable diseases due to shortages of medicines thanks in great part to exchange controls and corruption around such exchange control schemes.
youtube.
"In Iceland, the leaked files show how Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson and his wife secretly owned an offshore firm that held millions of dollars in Icelandic bank bonds during that country’s financial crisis ."
"The files include a convicted money launderer who claimed he’d arranged a $50,000 illegal campaign contribution used to pay the Watergate burglars, 29 billionaires featured in Forbes Magazine’s list of the world’s 500 richest people and movie star Jackie Chan, who has at least six companies managed through the law firm."
efore dawn on Nov.
"26, 1983, six robbers slipped into the Brink’s-Mat warehouse at London’s Heathrow Airport."
"The thugs tied up the security guards, doused them in gasoline, lit a match and threatened to set them afire unless they opened the warehouse’s vault."
"Inside, the thieves found nearly 7,000 gold bars, diamonds and cash."
“Thanks ever so much for your help.
"Have a nice Christmas,” one of the crooks said as they departed."
British media dubbed the heist the “Crime of the Century.
” Much of the loot - including the cash reaped by melting the gold and selling it - was never recovered.
Where the missing money went is a mystery that continues to fascinate students of England’s underworld.
"Now documents within Mossack Fonseca’s files reveal that the law firm and its co-founder, Jürgen Mossack, may have helped the conspirators keep the spoils out of the hands of authorities by protecting a company tied to Gordon Parry, a London wheeler-dealer who laundered money for the Brink’s-Mat plotters."
On Feb.
"10, 2011, an anonymous company in the British Virgin Islands named Sandalwood Continental Ltd."
loaned $200 million to an equally shadowy firm based in Cyprus called Horwich Trading Ltd.
"The following day, Sandalwood assigned the rights to collect payments on the loan - including interest - to Ove Financial Corp."
", a mysterious company in the British Virgin Islands."
"For those rights, Ove paid $1."
But the money trail didn’t end there.
"The same day, Ove reassigned its rights to collect on the loan to a Panama company called International Media Overseas."
It too paid $1.
"In the space of 24 hours the loan had, on paper, traversed three countries, two banks and four companies, making the money all but untraceable in the process."
"Family members of at least eight current or former members of China’s Politburo Standing Committee, the country’s main ruling body, have offshore companies arranged though Mossack Fonseca."
"They include President Xi’s brother-in-law, who set up two British Virgin Islands companies in 2009."
The leaked files show the firm regularly offered to backdate documents to help its clients gain advantage in their financial affairs.
It was so common that in 2007 an email exchange shows firm employees talking about establishing a price structure - clients would pay $8.
75 for each month farther back in time that a corporate document would be backdated.
"The world’s best soccer player, Lionel Messi, is also found in the documents."
The records show Messi and his father were owners of a Panama company: Mega Star Enterprises Inc.
This adds a new name to the list of shell companies known to be linked to Messi.
His offshore dealings are currently the target of a tax evasion case in Spain.
"Biggest leak in the history of data journalism, according to Snowden."
And it's about corruption.
This is great news.
reddit.
"This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy."
"Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked."
I am curious to see who turns up as well.
What a leak!
All coordinated by German newspaper namely the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
"As op linked toBefore reading further: Here is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by /u/Jaredlong:>Taxes sure do suck, right?"
Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them.
"Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government?"
"After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists."
"One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can ""spend"" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company."
"What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions."
"Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake."
"This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden."

This *could* be one of the biggest and most important leaks of all time.
Maybe finally people will wake up and realise that the entire world economic system is completely corrupted.
The harsh reality is that none of your information is safe from the richest and most powerful people in the world.
"There is solace in the fact that, on the other end, none of their information is safe from us."
"The term ""whistleblower"" is backwards and already outdated, and any conversation discussing what your government is lying to you about is a good one."
You deserve transparency from your rulers.
Leaks like these are the only remaining power the populace has over our government.
The founding fathers would be proud of this.

"""The little guy will pay for it""    - Michael BurrySums up a little more than banking I think."
"I think it's incredibly telling, that none of the major American news outlets (CNN, NBC or Politico) have anything about this on their websites."
"I would at least expect some small article mentioning what's happening, but there is literally nothing at all!"
This is incredible - there is potentially enough data there to keep even the most skilled forensic data experts busy for years.
Who knows what will tumble out.
"That said, I hate to be cynical, but can't see how this will ever fully be investigated or reported by newspapers owned by many of the wealthy conglomerates likely to be exposed here."

"Certain things like the double dutch sandwich, intracompany loans, and price altering are well-known when it comes to corporate tax management, but preserving personal wealth through the use of offshore trusts has always been a convoluted mess to understand."
The people that specialize in it get paid well because navigating the loopholes has gotten more and more difficult over the years.
I am really excited to see how the inner workings of these things work.
I don't have money by any means but this stuff has always been interesting to me.
"Supposedly, one of the worst people hit by these leaks is Putin, as it has the paper trail for how he makes his friends and himself wealthy."
This leak could literally be a game changer on a scale never yet seen in the world.
"Edit: To all the people replying, two things."
"First of all, this isnt our fight unless it is our country, already Iceland are calling for snap election, and those leaders like Putin, Assad an others we cant effect, they have enemies like the US and others who will act on drying up the cash flow."
"Secondly, those who say corruption is what rules the world need to remember that corruption is what kills Capitalism, as for it to work it needs to be a fair competition and more companies and nations want this competition as they see the corruption as a glass ceiling that needs breaking for them to stand a chance."
"To all the people here saying ""What does it matter?"
""" and anything of the like: We know."
"At some point, everyone has thought about it."
Human nature implies greed and corruption.
"This isn't the first time and, without a doubt, it won't be the last scandal of corruption."
"I could go on, but then I'd be descending into off-putting, philosophical ramblings."
So I'll just skip to the point.
Don't believe that you can't do anything as an individual.
Even the barest minimum of effort from one person can amount to something when it's combined with the barest minimums of millions.
"Find a way that's comfortable for you to do your part, whether it's a phone call to a senator, a conversation with an uninformed person, an upvote on an important post (such as this), or a signature on a petition."
"Or maybe, if you really want to show support, go full activist and attend rallies, protests, volunteer movements, etc."
Corruption is an inherent flaw in the system.
The best way to combat it is to bring it to light.
"Be vigilant and do your part, however small it may be."
Or don't.
It's your choice.

This is the most terrifying thing I have read in a long time.
"Whilst I dont think much of the bildeberg or the illuminati conspiracies, that all these influential individuals use one firm, to hide their wealth, do corrupt deals, and influence the world in such a large way, makes me wonder how many other firms just like this there are who have not had documents leaked."
The world is truly screwed
It's always somewhat disappointing when information like this comes out.
"Not because I feel bad for the companies, but a lot of folks often feel there's some sort of global corruption ring, explicit or implicit, tied up in international finance and such."
And the disappointment comes from when that is absolutely correct - that such corporations defy our brighter visions and ideals in their pursuit of financial gain.
Hopefully there's some significant fallout from this.
"I've spent the last year working on a paper about offshore asset protection trusts, and it's incredibly exciting that this world is about to be made public."
"These practices are carried out on the basis of winks and handshakes, and the whole offshore financial industry is built on self preservation through discretion."
"Disclosure of this magnitude is astounding, I'm looking forward to what happens next."
"Organisations like the FATF have been piling pressure on offshore jurisdictions for years, trying to force them to regulate asset protection practices more closely."
This sort of leak provides exactly the sort of ammunition they need.
"They said Assange was crazy, that his way of investigative journalism and full public disclosure was criminal, and that no one else would be following in his footsteps."
"Only ten years have passed since he founded Wikileaks and look at his legacy: Manning, Snowden, now this."
"His life is difficult, but I bet he feels incredibly proud"
"A quick look - this is all over BBC, The Guardian, Le Monde, The Irish Times websites."
"Front, huge font."
"It is nowhere on NYTimes, CNN, Fox, MSNBC, CNN, USAtoday, LA Times."
It is astonishing how pacified the US is.
Just astounding.
It's not because the citizens are dumb and uneducated.
They've just been trained not to care.
Unreal.
It's like an alternate universe.
:/ this died to fast.
What ever happened to these people?
"This type of corruption has always been practically a fact, but having actual data to back this up is incredible."
"Now the question is, given the government is probably in on it already, is anything really going to get done?"
I guess now they might not have a choice.
Before they could just pretend they did not know.
The jokes on you.
"While you guys are talking about his supposed story, CNN is reporting on the real stuff."
Their main story is a woman's soccer player getting a DUI.
Nice try Reddit.
Nothing to see here
Trillions of unpaid tax dollars.
While these people play and live the good life.
"If that money had been in the system, it would have created jobs."
It would have been continual economic stimulus.
The underfunded projects would have gone funded.
The world WOULD be a much different place!
This can not be left alone.
I'm curious to see how the world takes this news over the next few weeks.
Waiting for the US names to leak.
"Fingers crossed for Clinton, Trump and a gaggle of federal legislators"
Sounds like something Reddington orchestrated

Is there a way to keep a story on the front page for a while longer than normal for world affecting instances such as this?
Like a sticky post for a week?
The fact that no Americans are named in this list just means they are using a different shady company.
"Damn this is getting real guys, JFK tried to warn us in his address before the american newspaper publishers association in 1961."
"""It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions--by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper."
"For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day."
"It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations."
"Its preparations are concealed, not published."
"Its mistakes are buried, not headlined."
"Its dissenters are silenced, not praised."
"No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed."
""" Except now things are actually being revealed."
Lets hope this gets major news coverage.
Only 149 documents out of 11 million have been released.
Just those 149 documents have already taken down one world leader.
Ponder that for a moment.
I have a feeling that All the news in America will do some in depth reports on Kim Kardashian the day this is released.

This corruption lies deeper than what is shown.

The strangest thing is how some people thought this to be shocking.
The social divide in classes are gigantic.
And here people are in the U.
crying to each other about anti establishment and socialism when they should be rallying together to put an end to corruption to make it fair for all.
It is most definitely not fair for all.

TIL there is a 24 hour chip.
My sweet 27 year old nephew passed away from a heroin overdose on August 24 one year ago.

Currently in treatment for alcoholism.
"On day 71, this post gives me great hope for the future!"
Congratulations man.
"I just celebrated 4 years on 7/4 (silly american here, I mean July 4th)Great to wake up not dopesick."
EDIT: Holy shit this blew up.
Thanks for the gold and the other award I don't understand (press F.
I'm pressing F and it's not doing anything.

No one needs to die for anyone to get clean.
"Just to share the hope - in the summer of 2015 I lived in my car, was stealing money from my job every day to keep a $200 crack habit and bundle a day dope habit running."
Was in and out of motel rooms with random girls just to keep going.
"Couldn't see my kid, the locks at the house her mom and her lived in (and I once did too) had been changed."

"I have a MA now, work to help others, just bought a fucking house, and most of all, I live with peace and serenity, Shit still goes wrong, I still make poor choices sometimes, but I just live in the beauty of being a fallible human, always working to recovery, change, and live life one day at time."

Congrats!
I wonder how bedazzled the 10 year chip is.
Congrats My daughter cycled off methadone yesterday.
A little over a year clean and now she says her new clean date is 8/11Her on the left right before her 3rd overdoes and her now (well 2 months ago).
She’s had 11 friends die of overdoses.

First chip is 24 hours and second chip is 1 month?
Seems like a big jump.
I’m currently trying to stop.
any words of wisdom or advice anyone can share would mean so much to me.
I’m really tired of failing and hurting people that give a shit about me.
[deleted]
This is the first post I see as soon as I opened Reddit just now.
"Right before I opened it I was just beating myself up for not being in sober or in treatment yet, I’ve wasted the last 3 years and lost a lot of good friends and family and I’m ready to be done with everything, really."
"Seeing this is really a sign, it chokes me up."
This makes me so optimistic that I can get clean and also be 8 years clean one day.
I’ve lost 4 friends because of junk.
Keep up with it.
"Thats great, im 2 days clean from the xanax and the oxys."
Its hell to exist right now but it’ll be great once its over.
Concrats 23 years and it continues just for today

1 year and 9 months clean from Heroin today.
"Congrats, man."
7 years clean here.
Multiple dope friends around me died from the same shit we bought together.
I thank my lucky stars that I somehow walked away alive.
Keep it up
I'm two years sober from pills (oxy's) everyday is gift.
Keep going strong
Congrats!
I just celebrated my first year of sobriety from alcohol on 7/22.
Congratulations!
I'll have 8 years clean from opiate pain pills on September 26th.
I love when I see people getting over this because it has affected my family for a long time.
My brother is clean for 2 years now.
"I'm glad to have him back after 8+ years of lying, stealing, excuses, and wild (WILD) stories that make no sense."
The whole time he was addicted to it he never thought our relationship suffered.
"He told everyone that we were close, but the reality was that when he was an addict I really did hate him."
Not for stealing from me.
Not for lying to me.
He put an immeasurable amount of stress on my parents and grandparents as he was kicked out of my parents house and then my grandparents sheltered him.
"I remember sitting across the table from my grandparents trying to explain to them that they are the reason my brother is going to overdose because they are giving him a place to live and money to ""go to the movies""."
"Eventually, they gave him the ultimatum that he will go to rehab and once he is out, he will not be allowed back in their house."
He went to rehab 11 times over those 8 years and that was the one time that was different.
It's really nice to go hiking together and have normal conversations about life and whats new in our world.
For those of you still struggling out there don't give up on the people you love.
"There are some sad bitter people on this site, who apparently just can't stand to see someone succeed."
Don't like the content you see on r/pics?
Post something better then.
The rest of us are sorry for bothering you with the free content.
"Thread locked, go outside."
Congratulations on your continued sobriety.
I commend you for staying along the path and being so inspiring.
👍🏻 🥇.
"I just wanted to say, as someone who has had their own struggles, fuck opioids."
"Especially fentanyl, fuck fentanyl for real."
That shit is evil even if it's a prescription.
It seems like all I did was wait for 72 hours to put on another 100 mg transdermal patch.
Then I just started adding a patch while leaving the old one on.
FUCK ALL OPIOIDS.
Clean for roughly 4 years thanks to a great doctor that finally made me understand that opioids weren't effective for neuropathic pain.
"I don't do anything now except a blood pressure pill, but I will say that cannabis edibles are way more effective for neuropathic pain than any pharmaceutical I've ever been on and that's a long list."
"Sobriety coins are like Pokémon, gotta catch ‘em all."
Keep up the good work!
Bravo to you.
You deserve all the karma.
"Congrats, OP."
Stay vigilant.
Don't get complacent.
Addiction is an illness.
Get help if you need it.
My ex was sober for ten years.
She was doing great.
Got two masters degrees.
Successful job.
She slipped and built walls.
She pushed her parents away.
Pushed me away.
Told us she was still sober.
"Told us that work was kicking her butt, but nothing to worry about."
Got angry if we tried to help.
Her parents kept pushing.
They knew her bullshit from her truths.
They knew how well she lied when she was using.
But she resented them for the intervention the first time she got sober.
I tried to let her know I was concerned but not make it confrontational.
She asked me for money.
Said she needed food.
Told her I would buy groceries and then had to say no when she didn't want that.
She pushed us all away.
One night she attempted suicide.
I didn't ask her mom for details.
I did not learn until it was too late.
I imagine she dosed way up and tried to go lights out for good.
Her roommates found her and dropped her off in front of the hospital.
She got out later that day.
She went home and she made another attempt.
This time it worked.
She crushed her family.
Crushed me.
We had broken up but we were still best friends.
I loved her.
I miss her goofy personality.
I miss her nose (for whatever weird reason).
She taught me a lot about the nature of addiction.
It is a disease.
Not something an addict can just 'not' do.
It is a force.
And it will eat you alive if you get complacent.
Please stay sober.
Please let your family know when you are struggling.
Your death does not make it easier on everybody.
Good luck.
I hope you stay clean for life.
People love you and need you in their lives.
Thats 2920 days a fantastic accomplishment.
Congratulations.
It’s something to be proud of each and every day
You're a fuckin legend never forget.
This is really motivating.
I needed this.
Only a couple days sober and I feel like crying every minute.
This made me smile.
My mom suffered from alcoholism and has been 23 years sober this December.
Every year for the past 23 years her best friend has taken her to dinner on her anniversary and gives her a new chip.
"Coming from another person who’s lost loved ones and many friends to heroin, from the bottom of my heart I am so fucking proud of you ❤️"
So fucking incredible.
So happy for you.
Magnificent collection.
Congratulations.
Substance use and mental health therapist here.
Just want to tell you how incredibly proud and happy I am for you.
"Thanks for sharing this, not only to inform others of the AA and NA fellowship, but also for helping break the stigma around drug and alcohol treatment."
I would love to see you post more about your journey.
Keep on keepin on!
Congratulations 👍👍👌👌
To date already 37 years clean from heroin.
I’m so proud of you and am encouraging you from afar.
I lost my brother to heroin in March and have come uncomfortably familiar with how much you deserve a million rounds of applause.
Keep it up!
Amazing!
I'm coming up on 16 months now and I never wanna touch that stuff again.
CONGRATULATIONS!
"The work never stops, but you know that, keep up the fight and  be the amazing person you are."
"I was lucky enough to celebrate 4 years sober August 5th, good luck to you!"
"Congrats man, be proud, most people will never know what you've been through."
That's amazing.
I'm almost at 1 year and proud I cant even imagine!
"Keep it up, makes me know it can happen"
Just for today.
I'm 40.
2 yrs clean.
Applaud me.
Great.
Keep going !
I like how you kept your 24 hour chip.
You really make me think about going back for mine.
I have my one year chip but never picked up my other annual chips and I have been clean from alcohol for 8 years and clean from opiate abuse for the last 4 years.
This pic encourage me to go back and get my chips !
"Good on you, OP."
You could be one of tens of thousands dropping from fentanyl stepped on heroin today if you hadn't made the progress you have.
Addiction is so complicated and the brain and body are so fragile.
"It doesn't take anybody special to succumb to an addiction, but it takes a persistent mind and tenor to overcome said addiction."
Nice job man.
Must be so fucking tough to get clean and stay clean.
"Changing your habits and friend circle, being mindful of triggers, knowing how to say no when you're having a damn shitty down day."
Curious Q: when do they (if they do) stop giving chips or after 10 years do they increment in 5 or 10 from then on?
Keep coming back

This is crazy.
6 years this month for me.
Way to go!
Been seeing a low of photos of these on reddit lately.
What are they made of and are they the same on both sides?
Fuck yeah homie!
It’s been 15 years for alcohol and five years from crack for me .
So proud of you OP
Not trolling: if you relapse do you have to give the coins back?
How does that work?
Proud of you!
My dad is coming up on year 25.
He had a hemorrhagic stroke when he was 26 from a speedball.
He was paralyzed on the whole right side.
"He had to learn how to walk, talk, eat all over again."
He graduated with his RN in 2000 and is currently working on his nurse practitioner degree.
"If he can do it, you can do it."
Some days are harder than others.
"Sometimes you have to measure your sobriety in minutes, but every minute is a win."
"We celebrate his sobriety like a birthday, because that's when his life truly began."
i fucking love this so much.
Congratulations!
I'm proud of you
Today marks 10 months since I woke up in the back of an ambulance after ODing.
"It's been hard, but I got this, just like you OP"
[removed]
I'm so proud of you.
Congrats!
I know how hard it is!
"Me, alcohol."
I quit in 1989.
"I used to hear the ""old timers"" in AA meetings talking about 30 yrs of sobriety, and I was convinced that they were damned liars."
"I could not imagine a day without, much less 30 yrs."
"Now, I have a bunch of one-days-at-a-time which happen to add up to 30 yrs."
Keep doing what you are doing!
It works!
I strive for the serenity to   accept the things I cannot change  the courage to change the things I can  and the wisdom to know the difference.
"You’ll probably never see this comment, but I want to say congratulations and I’m proud of you."

Congrats.
"Never touched the stuff myself, but I know a lot of people who have and have watched them struggle and fail repeatedly before getting clean."
It's not easy.
Keep it up!
Good on you.
You have to want it.
"Rehab is an amazing resource for people that want to help themselves, and you’ve taken advantage of that."
Keep it up!
I hope you’re seeing how much better life is without heroin.
Congratulations man.
I don't know you but I'm so proud of you.
"If I may, and you do not have to answer as it might be very personal for you, but how did you do it?"
What led up to you quitting and recovering?
What was your process?
My brother is currently an addict and has been for about 5-7 years.
I feel like my family has tried everything to help him quit and he just won't.
Any advice or insight that you have would be appreciated.
"It might not help in the end, but it might give me some hope."
"If I don't get a response, that's ok."
Keep up your good work.
People like you are a great inspiration to many others out there.
2 years clean from meth/ opiates as of the eleventh for me :D
"Hot fucking pockets my guy, hella dedication"
What was the biggest help to you what did you do to overcome it?
I mean I know there is no big secret way to do it but what was the biggest help to you personally?
How much are those coins worth.
in heroin?
Home group came in clutch on the last 2 years!
I'm still waiting for my fancy medallion after 4 lol
2 years 9 months here.
makes my heart smile.
Thanks for the post!
I'm getting my one year chip for sobriety THIS SUNDAY and I'm stupidly excited
This is amazing!
So proud of you!
I'm 505 days clean off opiates.
It CAN be done!
As somebody who just got back on Vivitrol.
this is awesome to see.
it’s not heroin out there anymore.
It’s all Fentanyl and we are dying.
💥💥🙌💥💥
congrats :)
That’s so awesome!
I just can’t wait to have 5 years under my belt!
You are a hero!
Congratulations.
I’m on day 3 (not heroin).
Hardest thing I’ve done.
Hail yourself.
You’re an amazing example!
Fantastic!
I'll be celebrating 6 years clean time myself on the 19th!
"Congrats on 8 years, here's to many, many more."
"Today marks 5 years off pills for me, congratulations!"
I feel like they’re all saying “ooh cold” every time their feet hop to the ground
That is very surreal.

"As my grandpa used to say, ""I been to 3 county fairs and a goat roping but I ain't never seen nothin like that."
Somebody did not want to take the detour through the gate :p
Honestly I’ve never imagined snow in Australia.
Thanks.
One of those Kangaroos got some serious air over that fence.
*Jurassic Park theme plays in the background*
"To all the overseas readers, ignore the salty cunts in this thread bitching about hemispheres and snow every year, etc and trying to make out this is normal."
I'm a 40 year old Aussie who lives in the country and sees roos virtually every day.
"I have never seen a mob that big in the snow like that, it's proper cold in the south east corner of the country at the moment and there is more snow around than a lot of people have ever seen before."
"But don't worry, give it 3 or 4 months and everything will be on fire again and shit will be back to normal."
"Wait, why did I think kangaroos were solo animals?"
These bodybuilder animals exist in HERDS?
Australia is so perplexing.
"As a Brit who lived in Aus for a few years, I will never tire of watching Roos hop."
It’s fascinating.
I count at least 6 white boomers
ITT: People who do not know it's currently winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
I'm guessing you have to build a pretty high fence to keep kangaroos out of your pasture.
"Cute , snakes and bugs go away haha."
"Im in Australia rn, where is this I wanna go there"
Wow where do you live to see this?
Here in central Queensland you would be dreaming to look outside and see that.
How rare is snow in Australia?
Can't believe how many comments here so utterly shocked that some places in Australia gets snow in winter.
like is the stereotype so strong that we all live in the desert that you can't even fathom the idea that majority of us live in cities and environments just like the rest of the world?
Wonder if the rest of the world knows we eat the fuckers?
They are a pest in farming locations.
Edit - tasty fuckers - medium rare is considered well done
"This is like a game of the floor is lava, but the floor is ice"
Why do kangaroos hate the snow?
Cause then the kids have to play indoors
lol that one kangaroo in the front who stumbled didn’t skip a beat keeping up!
"For whatever reason, I just never imagined that kangaroos would live in such big herds and move around like that."
"I guess I'm used to seeing them laying down, sweltering in the shade all the time."
Even in zoos.
"It's a dumb misconception, but here I am."
[The Kangaroos seems to be hopping off fine.
On the other hand.
redd.
it/jucqd2ykbqf31.
I am an adult Australian who has travelled to every continent except for Antartica and I am still yet to touch snow.
I am hoping my town will get some!
Cuties enjoying the snow
"Thanks, this thread has shown me so much retardation I want to die."
Great shot though.
Fuck it's cold - kangaroos probably
[*Oh what fun it is to ride in a rusty Holden Ute!
"Op, an Australian: it’s not every day you get to see kangaroos hopping in the snow."
"Commenter: hmm, you’re right it’s not every day you get to see kangaroos hopping in the snow."
Every other comment: FUCKING AMERICANS!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WEATHER?
That one Kangaroo just hopped right over the fence like it was nothing
As someone who lives in Australia but in a part where it never snows it’s really fucking insane.
"Like it doesn’t make sense, it shouldn’t happen, but I’m looking at it."
"WTF, mate?"
I love watching kangaroos.
They move so cool.
Wild how it’s snowing in Melbourne right now and NSW is going through a massive drought.
"Ah, it happens every year."
It's called *WINTER*.
"Believe it or not, there are parts of Australia that get snow **every winter**."
"Started snowing near me yesterday, barely ever happens but when it does it’s wonderful."
Melted really quickly though.
Really weird having snow thick as shit when you leave to go for a walk and then coming back and it’s all melted up.
so now we've got nuclear winter.
everyone is dead except australia.
and they're still like wtf?
but they'll be dead soon.
fucking kangaroos.
This makes me happy.
Baby Tontons.
"♪ ""Hopping through the snow ♫♩ On a one-roo open sleigh."
Kangaroos: AHHHH FUCK THE WORLD IS ENDING!
"It’s surreal to me that this looks exactly like a something I would have seen as a kid in Colorado, except it would have been whitetail deer or antelope instead of kangaroos."
"I know it’s not anything exceptional, but it’s so strange to have my brain expecting those other animals and seeing the roos instead."
“Fucking Kangaroos” - The End Of The World
Thanks i **LOVE IT**
Damn one of them lept over that fence with no effort .
I’ve never imagined a herd of kangaroos hopping in general so this is pretty fucking cool
FENTON
The snow threw me waaay longer then it should have.
As a dumb American I forget that the southern hemisphere is experiencing winter right now.
I'm just here for the endofworld.
swf references
Whoa.
do kangaroos always travel in big groups like that?
There's so frigging many.
holy fuck.
never in a lifetime would i be able to picture this.
this is fucking impressive.
curious around which city this is?
It's not snowing in Australia right now there's just snow in very specific parts of Australia
The fact that Australia has snow while my town was the hottest place in America yesterday reminds me of how weird climate can be on Earth
But did he applaud the pilot for the safe landing?
"On a flight from Amsterdam to Boston I saw a woman - who was clearly not from Boston -  stand up, grab her bag, and stand in the aisle the moment they announce we were beginning our APPROACH to Logan."
"The rest of us are buckled in, phones off, gear stowed."
She was severely chastised by the crew.
It’s the “Adequate” trophy that gets me 😂
I just witnessed some guy GET UP and go to the washroom right when the plane was speeding up on the runway to start elevating.
Never heard the flight attendant so loud on the speaker telling someone to sit down lol.
Fuck people.
What an upstanding citizen.
On a flight in the U.
", we were arriving late, so the flight attendant asked everyone who didn't have a connection to stay in their seats so those trying to make one could get off the plane first."
The attendant knew there were lots of passengers without connections -- including me.
"Well, it didn't take long for everyone to start moving to the exits -- everyone but me."
"As the last of the other passengers were getting off, the flight attendant came back on the P."
"and said, in an irritated tone of voice, something like this:""I'd like to thank *the one passenger* who was kind enough to let everyone with connections go first."
And we have a gift for him.
"""As I left, the attendant handed me a stack of of huge chocolate-chip cookies -- like six of them -- from the first-class galley."
"It wasn't a trophy, but they sure tasted good."
"Ya know if I had to pick a thing about flying to get people to stop doing, it's not this."
Standing up in no way hurts me as long as you still wait your turn to leave.
What I CAN NOT STAND is how people crowd up against the luggage carousel so you can't see around them.
"If we all just stood back, everyone could see."
You could step up when you see your bag rather than sending against the goddamn thing the whole time.
It drives me nuts!
"In Italy we need the award ""didn't applause when the plane landed"""
"A couple of weeks ago I  was on a flight where this lady in the row behind me got up just after the pilot made the final descent announcement, removed her cabin bag and kept it in the aisle so she can get a headstart i guess."
"OMG, my last flight was 10 hours long, we took an additional 40 minutes extra to go around weather (which you would have never guessed based on the turbulence we went through), then after landing we were told we needed to be towed and had to wait for the tow vehicle thing."
"An hour later, we are still sitting on the runway as they tell us it broke and they have to get one from another runway."
"So nearly an hour and a half later, 12+ hours in a tiny seat, they opened the door and we all jumped up within seconds, and I didn't blame everyone."
We were soooo done.
"He’s beauty and he’s grace, he’s miss United Airlines."
"No, everyone remain seated, then as it clears in front of you, take five minutes figuring out how to extract your bag from the overhead."
People who think you shouldn’t stand up when the plane lands are all under 6’ and don’t feel cramped.
imgur.
"First of all, ~~nobody~~ ~~stands~~ most people don’t stand when the plane lands, they stand as soon as the plane pulls up to the exit ramp, and the “fasten seatbelt” sign is turned off."
"That aside, I find it more way more annoying when some jerk waits until it’s his turn to deplane before standing and searching for his bag."
"Get your shit together, and be ready to walk motherfucker."
"*edited because of course there’s always one, or two assholes, but in general most people don’t do this as the OP implied."
Ever notice that those same people are the ones who take fucking ages to get their luggage down?
And are therefore the people who should definitely wait the longest.
To preempt the 900th time someone's started this argument: I stand up as soon as I'm allowed to because I have long legs and my knees hurt because airlines have economized legroom out of existence for lowly coach passengers.
"I'm not rushing you, I'm just sick of sitting."
There is so much effort put into this I spent at least 25 seconds staring at the screen taking it in.
The adequate got me
The guy in the back is wiping his tears.
I’m sitting next to the winemaker for that bottle of wine as we speak!
I work for the winery.
As a regular flyer I find this behavior very annoying some people even get up while the plane is still taxiing
I love it when the aisle seat passenger stands and awkwardly hunches over the seat in front of him for 10 whole minutes with his ass a foot from my face while I read my book.
A lot of people just stand up after landing to stretch their legs.
But yeah.
Is the guy in back wiping away a tear
"Last time I flew, after we landed there was a lady who no shit just repeatedly asked me if she could squeeze by EVERYONE standing in the aisle to get to her bag at the front of the plane, despite sitting in the back."
Doors weren't even open yet.
"I told her you're just gonna have to wait, I didn't tell her nobody gives a shit about you or your own shit, That's what you get for getting greedy with the overhead bins, would it have been so terrible for your shit to get checked at the gate, It's not like they would have thrown it out in the Hudson."
Bitch.
That steward in the back wiping his 'tears' makes this picture come together
"Alternate Title: ""*The guy in this picture didn't have a connecting flight leaving in 5 minutes*""If someone standing up after a plane gets to the gate and the fasten seatbelt lights turns off gets you angry you need to reevaluate your life."
I have a story about this.
Always go by the row by row rule when exiting the plane I assumed that was the unspoken rule.
So I can see a guy 4 rows behind me as I am sitting on the aisle is pushing in between the middles and windows to get ahead.
As he gets closer to my seat with his rolling case I just put my foot in front grab bag from adjacent bin and start to move.
He rattles off “Don’t fucking push in front of me!
” Prepared statement response I rattle “it goes row by row not by how quickly you’re standing” he spurts out as I am walking down the aisle 5 steps ahead of him “SHUT THE FUCK UP” I laughed and said “I’m fine thanks”.
As you can tell it’s my dinner party go to anecdote.
As a tall guy lmao @ the babies in this thread that can't handle sitting another three minutes.
"I am a 6'2"" tall man, being stuffed into a tiny cramped seat for 3 hours, I am standing up as soon as fucking possible and ain't nothing you can do about it."
Took a flight last month and as soon as the plane landed a woman stood up to get her bags on the compartment.
"The flight attendant immediately spoke on the microphone: ""please stay on your seats untill the plane has fully stopped""."
I swear the woman stoop up on her seat and kept getting her bags from the compartment.
oooh Evolution Red blend by sokol blossor.
That stuff is tasty and not too expensive either.
"I like to believe he was already wearing the gloves and tiara, and only the sash is part of the award ceremony"
I like to stand as soon as I can to stretch my legs and back.
I know I'm not getting out anytime soon.
I thought that was obvious and that a lot of people do it?
I don't get the people at the back of the plan who jump up and go down the aisle acting like they're gonna get off the plane immediately.
But did they clap at the end?
How would I know if the flight has ended if there's no clapping?
"I should probably start clapping at the end of train rides, bus stops and taxis reaching their destination to be on the safe side"
"I'm 6'5""I don't fit in airplane seatsI stand up as soon as the plane hits the gate so that I can go from having my knees crammed into my chest to having straight knees and a hunched back."
It's literally just changing my posture as much as the space will allow because I'm in literal pain after a flight.
Now they need one for not clapping when the plane lands.
I thought this was “El Profesor” from Money Heist.
Clearly not an Italian flight.
You people will never understand how important it is to be the first person waiting at baggage claim.
"But sometimes I just have to stretch my legs after a long-ass flight, and in Economy Class the only way to do that is to stand."
The worst part of being on a plane is having to sit so long.
Standing is fine as long as you don't block the aisle.
"I usually stand up right after seatbelt goes off, especially when I’m travelling with equipment from work."
"That way no one is waiting on me to get stuff out from the overhead and beneath my seat, also being 6’2 it’s nice to stand after being fettered."
What pissed me off as a passenger was when we had a delay and they specifically said for only people that had to meet a connecting flight should get off first and there were only like 5 of us that stayed sitting down.
I know those fuckers were just being self-centered.
I don’t really have a problem if people want to stand up.
"If you have an aisle seat, go ahead and stand up after a long flight."
My only problem is people that don’t respect the order of exiting row by row.
"Yeah I'm sorry (also not sorry), but the seats are so squished together and uncomfortable that I need to get up after a 4 hour flight."
Some of the biggest annoyances are brought on by the airlines themselves.
Bruh I do that when I’m window but if I’m Aisle then I don’t wanna piss off the window person who’s trying to leave
Fuck this joke!
"I stand when the plan stops because I'm 6'5"" and I've been in a cramped seat with my knees pressed against the seat in front of me for two+ hours."
I want to stand as soon as I can and I refuse to be shamed for it!
Why does this bother people so much?
I’ve been sitting for the past 8 hours let me stretch my damn legs
[deleted]
I always stand up as soon as the seat belt light goes off.
"I've been sitting in a cramped uncomfortable ""chair"" and I'm ready to stand up and stretch."
I can also grab my carry on from the overhead and be ready to walk when the line moves.
They should be thanking me for helping move things along.
And I never get a seat in the back of a plane.
I want to get off that sardine can as soon as possible.
Was this a huge selling feature when you bought the place?
"I works pay extra for this feature, as well."
At :50 “GET YO ASS DOWM FROM THERE!
"The moms like"" get yer ass down from there NOW!"
"If you don’t mind me asking, where do you live?"
Just a little more information.
This is the 2nd year I've owned the house and 2nd time I've seen it happen.
But basically this bobcat is smaller then last years mom and I can only think that it's actually one of the kittens from last year.
"The little space under the roof on the right is actually where she gave birth and the kittens like to sleep, it's pretty decent shelter."
"Also, I don't want to do anything more than just put up a camera."
"Because I've seen a few people suggest building a dog house or something, but they are wild animals and needed to be treated as such and cant get used to humans."
"Literally last week in another part of town, some guy decided to pick up one of the kittens in his yard and ended up getting stitches."
"So as much as they are adorable, they are still wild and dangerous!"
I have been super tempted to put up some kind of ball up there though lol.
Edit: Wow this post went crazy really fast.
Thanks for all the gold and platinum!
"I have a LOT more videos of all this but the camera I have up there at the moment wouldn't really let me live stream, I'd have to set up a different one."
"They leave during the day since they aren't locked up there, but in the morning and afternoon they are usually playing there."
If people are actually wanting me to livestream on twitch or something I can probably set that up.
Oh my gosh they act exactly like house kittens 😄 haha and momma yells at the little guy who ventured to far 😍
"They're beautiful, and that was a brilliant idea."
Omg I loved when the momma bobcat yelled at the baby for his shenanigans haha
"I now know what ""Get down from there!"
""" in bobcat sounds like"
Poor mama cat trying to bathe and her kittens are climbing all over her.
How on earth can you get anything done?
My entire day would be spent watching this adorableness!
"Welp, that's the cutest thing I've seen all week."
The close up on that baby bobcat belly was awesome!
"Man, you need to livestream this shit."
"That, is a special type of awesome"
"I don't know what I expected a bobcat to sound like, but it wasn't quite that."
Neat.
[You got games on ya phone?
I 💕💕 this so much!
TY for sharing!
Got more?
That mama cat is gorgeous.
I'd be super tempted to throw a ball up there too.
How did you find them up there?
I’m picturing you hearing random noises and then going up to the roof and being greeted by a mom bobcat and the cutest kittens ever.
"However, the mom is super protective and attacks you."
"Just when you thought the world was only a negative black hole filled with atrocities and hate, this comes along and you realize it is."
But it has this in it too.
Thank you stranger!
Lol  she yells  like a mom at the supermarket.
"@1:01 That's bobcat mom for, ""you get down from there NOW!"
did not know they made that sound
After the Bobcat leaves with its cubs it returns to its own domicile to watch all the video she's captured of you during her visit to your home.
I'm fucking dying over this!
I love her yelling at her baby!
It's pretty adorable.
little furry bundles of life 😭😭
"""Get your ass down from there Riley."
"""Oi, Thing One!"
Get back down here!
I'd watch a live stream of this.
I would totally and completely watch the hell out of a live stream of this.
You are SO LUCKY!
Sorry for yelling I’m just really excited for you.
If you do have to resell the house this should add at least a million to the value
Your roof wins the internet today.
I like when the Mom yells at the one telling it to get down.
I thought it was great one year that I put one up in a tree to watch a robin nest.
This is a million times better than my birdie cam.
This deserves to break the internet.
"It looked like she was saying ""HEY get down from there!"
I'm pretty sure you haven't seen a rodent anywhere in your vicinity for years.
This is very cool.
There's something about a cat walking up to a video camera to investigate that just makes me laugh like crazy.
Oh my goodness.
You must get *nothing* done!
"You know mama was like : ""Get your ass down RIGHT NOW!"
Maybe this is our future?
Solidarity.
"salesman: *slaps roof*""this bad boy can."
"ew cat shit"""
Do you know why they chose your roof?
You should send this footage to a local conservation/wildlife group.
"I bet this kind of footage of a mother bobcat and her young may be relatively rare, I'm sure they would love to have access to your tapes."
"&#x200B;Very cool video, thank you for providing a respawn point for these beautiful animals."
They are beautiful
This bobhuman wants a bobcat.
I could watch this for HOURS
This is by far the best thing I've seen all day.
Thanks for posting!
This person is living the coolest of lives.
"It's one of her babies that comes back to their childhood roof, give birth, cycle continues."
Please set up a live stream!
This is national geographic level shit
Pretty sure the market value of your home just went up
Thank you for being such an accommodating human for your roofguests.
And thank you for sharing some of their antics with us!
Did you drop the dogs pillow out the window?
"I love how she yells at them at the end, ""hey, get down from there!"
""" Moms gonna mom."
Non Arizonans should know that bobcats are EXTREMELY dangerous despite the appearance.
Cat parents are incredibly patient with their kids playing on top of them.
You’ve just hit the Reddit jackpot.
That little guy's so curious ❤
This footage is probably really valuable (academically) to the people that study this kind of stuff.
You should share it with them.
"It would be a great tool for understanding behaviour, habitat encroachment, diet, hunting habits and patterns, morbidity rates etc."
Its amazing!
Plot Twist: mother bobcat shows her bobcat community surveillance footage of the humans nesting below her
I can see why!
"Great spot away from predators, shade, a cozy bedtime nook, OH!"
"Get the fuck down from there, Kevin!"
"""You get down from there right now mister!"
This is the content i signed up for
"It would indeed take much of every ounce of my self control, not to abduct one of those kittens from the rooftop, and hug him, and squeeze him, and call him George."
"And so you sir, u/littlebill246, are a true Zen Master in control of his emotions!"
"I am ready to learn from you, though I am most likely not worthy."
I want to buy you an internet connection and amazon you a webcam so we can stream live.
This is awesome
Your roof looks like the Casablanca roof in Allied
This is like watching DIY Planet Earth and I’m very into it
This needs more upvotes
Aaaaaa the cats look cute
Mama sure gave the kitten on the parapet a talkin' to.
"Great stuff, thanks for sharing it."
Dude that is freagin awesome!
Mommy kinda sounds like a car alarm.
Not what I was expecting.
You’re very lucky.
Awesome - looooove bobcats
So what’s it like having a bobcat family living in your yard?
"Forgive me if this sounds like a whine, but  *I* want a house with baby bobcats on the roooooof."
You have blessed us all thank you
I need to get me a roof like that!
WOW What a beautiful clip!
"Oh sweet jesus, the close-ups."
I want many updates
"Oh damn they make a barking noise, I had no idea."
Thanks for this cool post OP!
OP is living my dream.
Where do I have to live to have a bobcat giving birth on my rooftop?
WE DEMAND LIVE FEED!
"At the end, you can see her saying ""Get down from there!"
""" to the kittens 🤣"
Beautiful creatures.
We really should take better care of the land we all share.
“Jeremy!
Get down !
Damn him”!
"Kitten climbs the roof, mama Bobcat *Get down from there little one or I’ll whoop your butt!"
Can you hear their feet pitter-pattering on the roof from inside?
Needs some David Attenborough
"I don't know why I was imagining construction equipment giving birth on your roof, but I really like my headcannon more."
It's like they have lil eyeliner on their lil eyes
The little one is on to you
You are such a great host !
And it almost seems like the  kittens know they are being watched.
this is fantastic!
please publish more videos
Gonna need vids daily since they live in frontth of the camera
I wish this was on live stream; I'd watch it when I'm having a lot of anxiety.
What an awesome video  Well done :-)
They’re gorgeous
Setup a live cat cam?
This might be my favorite video of all time.
Please upload more.
I was not expecting that sound from the mom
Robertcat
Wow they are beautiful
It would amazing if you could set up a live webcam stream so we can watch any time!
"Mom, cleaning herself unperturbed:“."
wait.
Jimmy!
JIMMY!
"Goddammit, get down right now Jimmy!"
It's so cute when they practice their murders AawwwwwwzzzSeriously though I love it
That ended too soon.
So freaking cute.
"It seemed like the momma cat was telling that child to ""get the fuck down from there right Now!"
Video was not long enough!
More baby bobcat!
"""Seamus Jeffrey Mcgruder!"
Get down here right now before I get up there and drag you down by your tail stub!
"we now know how to say ""young man you get down from there right now!"
""" in Bobcat."
You better post weekly update video.
I NEED MOREREEE
Can we get a subreddit just for this?
Please?
Love how momma is fine with those 2 little ones playing and ruff housing.
"Then the curious dude gets up past the cam, and momma barks at him to “get your ass down from there!"
” Fade out.
"More people appear running onto the scene and grab Tank Man, rushing him away before signalling to the tanks."
Nobody knows who Tank Man was or what happened to him.
It's suggested that the people who grabbed him were plain-clothed officers.
Considering what they did to the students in that square I don't have high hopes that they took him back home and he lived a long happy life.
EDIT: the owner of the original video I posted disabled playback on applications other than YouTube.
I've replaced the link with another video for convenience.
I think I remember the photographer telling the story of how he smuggled this picture out of the country.
Apparently he was spotted taking the photo and ended up hiding the roll of film in a film canister in the water tank of his toilet.
He then replaced the film in his camera with an empty roll of film.
The police came in stole the camera and (empty) film and he smuggled the real roll with this photo out.
The details may be wrong but I remember it being a kinda wild story about this picture.
Holy fuck.
I’ve never seen this pic before.
Do you know what is wayyyy more powerful?
org/June4th/massacre.
org/June4th/massacre.
"html)Warning, it's graphic."
"But real, very real."
"Being 43 and seeing this picture a million times, I never really realized."
I have no idea what happened after this.
What happened to this guy?
Such a nice picture of an empty space where nothing specific happened in 1989
[deleted]
"I like this picture, I studied it a lot when we did a brief course on Propoganda at school."
I always find the most striking thing about this photograph is the behavior of the tanks.
"These are Chinese version of Russian T-62 tanks, they weigh around 37 tonnes and could easily run Tankman over and considering they are on their way to machine-gun down civilians running one man down wouldn't seem a problem."
"But they don't, they stop, they all stop, on a road with 14 lanes where they could easily run down or simply drive around one man blocking the road they all get into a line and stop."
"These soldiers were obeying orders, had they refused both they and their families would have been at risk, but suddenly they have an excuse to stop and that is exactly what they do."
"43 tanks if anybody interested to countEdit - 45 tanks, thanks to u/i4mn30"
I've counted at least 30 tanks in that picture and probably way more off frame.
The cropped version only showed 3 or 2 tanks (Can't remember replaced my memory of it with this now).
"This guy has become 10x more the hero than he already was, I've never ever seen this picture before."
"He shows what people are willing to do for freedom and on the opposing side, he exposes the government and THEIR limits that they are willing to cross time and time again."
"For anyone who might have noticed that the tanks towards the front are out of line, the reason is they tried to go around him when he refused to move."
"As they turned, he moved to continue to be in front of the tank."
He didn’t just simply stop in the middle of the road in front of the tanks.
He moved around to block attempts to go around him
So it wasnt a handful of armoured tanks it was dozens of them.
To kill unarmed citizens.
Keep sharing this photo.
These are the tanks that rolled over and liquified the bodies of the murdered students.
They then literally swept the evidence down their drains.
The gory ones really got to me.
Humans turned into paste by soldiers of their own country.
Must be terrifying having this constant threat hanging over their heads.
[deleted]
This is the oppression that we should all be fighting against.
Politics all over the world have become so controversial that we forget that we should all be fighting for the right for everyone to be a part of those controversies.
I often take for granted the right that I have to publicly criticize the President or other leaders while many others around the world dream of the opportunity to do so.
imgur.
jpg Here’s a picture of the aftermath.
Free HK!
This is a response of like 30+ large battle tanks to an unarmed protest.
"No matter how you look at it, that is just wrong."
People like to complain at times about the western government response to protests of riot police and so on but it's nothing compared to the response in authoritarian dictatorships like China where they send in modern (at the time) battle tanks to put down unarmed protesters.
If the Hong Kong protests were on the mainland this would be the response.
I mean they've got a legit genocide going on in mainland China right now.
"what happened to him, finally?"
I've never fully understood.
why did they stop the tanks?
Hadn't they already used tanks to squash people?
It’s not cropped they’re different photos from different photographers.
I don't think people fully understand just how bad the Tiananmen massacre really was.
"The death toll originally was estimated at up to 3000 dead, there has since been documents released saying that AT LEAST 10,000 people were slaughtered."

"Wow, this image is so much more dystopic than the original."
I wonder what happened to this guy
I know I may get downvoted because of this.
But what ever happened to the guy?
"If anyone is more interested in Tank Man, PBS did a documentary years ago about the event and the man."
One of the best docs I've seen about the Tianamen Square Massacre.
It’s only powerful if you’re used to the cropped one.
The reason the tighter framing is popular is that Tank Man is more easily noticed.
"It’s a trade off and if a viewer is not familiar with the image, this larger view might just look like a tank parade at a casual glance."
Photography is always a game of trade offs.
One day the chinese government will fall and its leaders hung from the flagpoles.
It is the onward march of history who bends toward liberty
Thank you for your hardwork and dedication.
"However, we regret to inform you that we are no longer in need of your services and your position has been terminated."
Fuck China
"OP, do I have your permission to repost this tomorrow?"
I need some karma too.
It is a shame that the courage that person showed is in as small amounts as the pic suggests as well.
So many statists lined up in fancy armor and deadly cannons vs one person with freedom in their head and courage steeling their nerve.
Thanks for the share.
"China has 800,000 to 1,000,000 Muslims in concentration camps"
This image is just a karma grab at this point.
What message is being sent that hasn’t already been sent a thousand times?
"I can guarantee you, Reddit do not care if this image goes viral or not."
It’s just free coverage for the site once a news article goes> Redditors just OWNED Reddit with picture of Chinese man and tank!
The China karmawhoring all over reddit is really getting old
"That guy standing infront of the approaching tank, was he squished by the tank?"
I've seen another image but it was like.
horrible.
the comments said they were ran over multiple times before being charred to ash and hosed down.
I disagree with the OP.
"The cropped version focuses more on the tank man, bringing more into focus the humanity about to be destroyed."
I can understand their viewpoint though.
Fuck the Chinese government!
Ban me Xi JingPooo
"Fun fact, after they got over the whole ""we'd rather not run them over thing"" they quite literally started running over the bodies intentionally to make it easier to clean up."
"""Protestor paste"" is I believe the phrase I'd heard associated with it."
Wait aren't you going to do the same title as all the other Tiananmen Square re-posters?
"If you wan't to get that good karma you gotta say it like ""Tiananman Square, 1989, 1."
"4 billion people in China have never seen this picture"" or something similar, you can be a bit creative and move some of the words around if you like, I don't think it effects how many thousands in Karma you can whore up."
Fuck you.
You don’t care about the Chinese.
You know deep down that this is doing nothing.
You just want imaginary internet points.
Stop with this bullshit.
man i wish the mods have the balls to delete karmawhoring shit like this.
this shit has been reposted so much to the point it doesn't add anything value to this sub.
This is adorable.
Fully checked the kitchen for an empty bottle of wine.
"That seems like a, ""my significant other is out of town so I'm cleaning while I drink wine"" dance."
"Sorry, bro."
Kinda sucks that this is how you find out your dog is cheating on you.
[deleted]
Image you see this and you don’t own a dog.
I can't wait to have a dog.
Dude she is stepping out on you while you're away!
"That other guy looks like a total dog, too."
She is my SO and yes she knows about the cameras.
Edit - My house is smart and only accessible trough a VPN.
She have access to the cameras too.
I was not spying; I got an alert because it was after midnight and security was armed.
Edit 2 - We foster dogs from the local humane society from time to time and we like to make sure Nina our dog (the one in video) is getting along we the foster dog while we are at work.
We also have an  electronic doggy door so we need to be able to see if the dogs are in or out.
(We have a fenced yard and dogs can go in and out as they please)Edit 3 - Nina wanted to say hi to everyone.

Steal yo gurl.
Man finds wife with his best friend on camera while on a business trip.
in his own house no less
"Just as I suspected, she's dancing with other men"
"Well, you've been replaced."
I love her.
"you all know what to do, let’s pick apart OPs kitchen."
"I dance with our dogs when my husband is home, why would us dog dancers change just because someone is out of town?"
Never
[deleted]
"Never let her go, OP."
Life is much more interesting with a woman like that.
Plot twist: OP has neither a dog nor a girlfriend.
I’m listening to ‘Juice’ by Lizzo and they’re dancing perfectly in time with the music!
is that you hank hill?
This is so pure and awesome .
Made me smile and wanna dance with a dog too.
Too bad I have a cat.
She is cheating with your best friend!
Solid proof!
I bet they even sleep in your bed together.
“The dog never dances with *ME*”
And with your best friend too :'(
I danced with my dog this morning.
His moves are trash.
and I don't own a dog or have anyone staying there!
"Plot twist, he's single and doesn't have a dog."
When you spy on your girl and realise you're a POS because she's wholesome af.
"Damn, I need a dog"
"Your dog, stole your girl, watcha gonna do?"
Lucky no peanut butter was involved
I call next dance!
So cute!
What is SO?
"My wife does the exact same thing, lol"
Looking like your dog is trying to steal your girl
Do you own a dog?
[deleted]
I too have dance parties in my kitchen with my dogs
"I was really expecting this to take some weird, disturbing turn."
I need to spend less time on the internet.
Dance like no one is watching
Funny thing is he doesn't have a dog or girlfriend.
This is so fricking cute
"This shouldbe the one time when you can say, ""Man, she's been cheating on you."
"Hence, you should marry her."
Did this women consent to you using her voyeur camera footage?
"Everyone is praising the cuteness, but this was kinda creepy to post at someone else's expense ."
"This could have been something she doesn't want 135,000 redditors to see ; an event she believed was being conducted in the privacy of her own homeEdit: OP is a lawyer"
Marry her
You vs the dog she told you not to worry about.
That cheating bitch!
With your daughter/wife nonetheless!
Edit: /s I guess?
Haha who is that?
I have a terrier mix so I have to pick him up when I’m dancing around my apartment.
Is that your dogsitter?
But what's the doggos name?
Also more pup pictures would be appreciated.
Plot twist: OP doesn't have a girlfriend/wife or dog!
&#x200B;Plot twist 2: OP is married but that isn't his wife.
OP's dog is having an affair with his girlfriend
"""i checked to see if my best friend was piping my wife and saw this"""
Imagine not having a dog or a wife and seeing this
As a full time dogsitter I can confirm this is 100% what we do when you aren’t around
Your bitch can dance.
not so much the wife tho
Awwww!
You got a a two for one!
Saw doggo and SO dancing.
I'm sure it made you smile and miss them more.
Just take those old records off the shelf
My wife does this with our dog.
It makes me happy
Sigh.
It's always your best friend
"Plot twist, OP lives alone"
I love that dogs are always ready to party no matter what.
Start dancing around?
Dog gets hype and joins right in.
Celebrating something?
Dog’s ready to chime right in with howls of his own.
Dogs are so pure.
Does your dog sitter know you have indoor house cameras?
Plot twist.
OP knows neither the dog or the lady in the footage.
Damn ur bestfriend is dancing with your girl in your own house.
You hate to see it 😔
Someone’s happy you aren’t there!
Why tf are there cameras in your kitchen.
Your girl is cheating on you with your best friend.
Tell me you neither have a wife or dog
"Most dogs love unconditionally, have zero expectations, & give pure raw loving kindness."
do you know her?
This is why I don’t want a camera inside the house.
I don’t want my bf catching me doing something weird
"Marry her, Give the doggo a good boi pat and treat"
OP this is so sweet.
For some reason I’m imagining they’re dancing to “Achy Breaky Heart”.
Very sweet.
That would make me want to get on a plane ASAP and get home to join in!
they have moved on without you
Dont act like you didn't do something like that with your dog we all did that
Am i the only one who thinks its weird to have cameras inside the house like that?
Even if ur SO is ok with it.
feels different.
Not judging btw.
Just thinking out loud :).
Peanut butter.
They so happy you are gone
Why do people put cameras in their houses connected to a network isn't this a huge privacy concern?
You know your place now.
It’s 12:47 am and your SO is still in jeans when you are out of town.
clearly not like my SO who would wear nothing but my sweat pants and hoodies all day day and night.
"I love how even when they’re unsure of what’s happening, dogs are happy and wagging their tails as long as they see their owner is enjoying him or herself"
Peanut butter happy dance.
Dogs are dancing all the time with their tails.
tbh i read this title and immediately checked the sub it was in.
"was relieved to see r/aww and not r/tifu, because i could see this title leading to an entirely different outcome."
I've watched enough SAW movies to know exactly what is going on here!
Wonder what else she does with the dog when you're away.
Cameras are all fun and games until your SO catches you picking your nose.
The weird part is he doesn't either have a girlfriend or a dog.
You have been replaced
Tumblr has this.
Doesn’t work properly but it has it
Outstandig move
Undo me
This would have come in handy many a time
imagine not having Apollo
Genius
Thank you 'reddit is fun'.
You're the real mvp.
"I literally just scrolled all the way up by accident and this was the first post, are you watching me?"
Omg this is genius.
Just like tumblr
I normally count on the random scroll to the top to tell me its time to get off reddit.
This is why Apollo is better than the reddit app 😈
that would be great for us mobile ppl
I accidentally pressed refresh and this meme was at the top of my feed :(
The Apollo app for Reddit has this feature It’s iOS only tho
As I just scrolled back to the top and landed on this…
I’m down fuck yes
Too many times I’ve accidentally done this.
Too many.
The first thing that I see when I  accidentally hit refresh
Tumblr does
This happened to me right now!
What perfect timing.
Problem is when you scroll up it also refreshes.
Or if you just hit the reddit home icon again it brings you back down
Im the 69th comment.
I am god for once
Yesss plz
RedditIsFun has this.
Whenever I tap back too many times on my phone it asks if I meant to do that and offers to return me to where I was.
PC users: What is this some kind of peasant joke?
Am I too rich to understand?
Reddit is fun has a forward button in case you push the  back button
Ur gonna be the top votes post in this sub if u get 2k moreGood luck!
I’ve lost count off how many times I’ve accidentally clicked off the picture I was looking at and it brings me all the way back to the top of the page.
Please do its so annoying having to scroll back 3 hours worth of  memes and other things
Somebody take this meme to the council.
let them decide
Or a bookmark thing
Modern problems require modern solutions.
Like Netflix already have so many things to scroll up and down.
You should be okay there
Must*
Best idea ever
Shark tank
"Yes, ten thousand times, YES"
A great ideA
Fucking please
Dear god yes
Modern problems require modern solutions
Yaas!
Queen!
"for some reason when i fullscreen the post then rotate the screen, it scrolls me back to the top"
I legit just accidentally went to the top and saw this
"Yes, cool"
Truth 100
genius
Modern problems require modern solutions
I just saw this post because I refreshed my feed by mistake
Make it happen people
That's how I saw this post actually.
[Serious]
Take my money.
"Reddit should save where u left off, rather than refreshing to the top when u leave the app, im not a no life that spends all his time on social media"
"I just by accidentally went to the top of my feed, only to be greeted by this."
What a coincidence
YESS I HAVE DONE THIS TOO MANY TIMES!
"# Come On Reddit### *please add this, you don’t wanna know how many times i have accidentally scrolled back to top."
Mobile has this
Everyone liked that
Throwback Thursday?
More like Scrollback Thursday!
I use an app called Reddit Is Fun.
It has that option.
Please!
When this happens.
i just give up and close reddit for the night.
"If Reddit does only one thing for us, I would be happy if it was this"
I've been using redditisfun so long I forgot that's not in the official app
Shake to return
Minecraft good
I did this while trying to upvote lol
Or perhaps a save spot
Yes yes yes (please)
"I literally close the app when this happensIf for nothing else, just fix this so that users don’t close the app and you can make more ad revenue off of us for staying on longer :)"
Not only reddit lol
Call it regreddit button
It should
I need this.
Just do it
Imagine using reddit mobile*this post was made by Relay for Reddit gang*
"That's how I got here, so yes please."
"What's that meme where the caption is like ""take out your calculators"" then it's the bomb from cs:go"
*checkpoint*
How long till this gets added to Apollo if we ask nicely.
Here I am on the Reddit Is Fun app possessing this power
PLEASE.
Much yes
This is upvote worthy
Reddit is fun.
Absolutely love hitting the forward button when I fuck up
Tumbler has this feature and I love it.
It’s a no brainer for reddit
It’s like stepping on a landline.
It’s exactly the same.
Biggggg facts
Not all heros ware capes!
Let's start a petition
*fuck go back* button
Beep beep!
I'm all about top posts!
Not the hero we need.
But the hero we want.
that would be great
Actually you can stop the refreshing by scrolling down
Use the Redditisfun app!
Reddit is fun
I use reddit sync or PC and this had never happened to me?
Is this common ok the official reddit app?
You should run for president.
Reddit regulars truely understand
Pdf readers need this too.
Especially after following a citation to the references
They really should tho
🏆🏆🏆Seriously.
I hate being an unashamed hour or two into scrolling and then getting zoomed back up to the top.
I use Reddit is fun they have an option for this I think
That will be so helpful
I mean every social media app needs this not only reddit
"so we don’t actually get the 9/11 reference, i’m the 912th comment"
EXACTLY
Start a petition
Me: *someone who never has this happen to them*Me: *upvotes*Me: [.

That s not how this works
Pretty please with sugar on top.
Reddit.
*Laughs in mobile*
So many upvotesGimme me some.
Sooooo maaaaany tiiiiiimmeeessss
Or they should ask if u really want to scroll up
When this happens I just give up and go to sleep.
This happens all the time.
It's stupid that they don't have something in place to prevent this.
"Honestly, that's usually how I know I'm done with Reddit for the day."
#MAKE A PETITION ON CHANGE.
Imagine reddit listening lol
"#Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/SackJnyder!"
[Let us not forget the Champions of yore.
reddit.
Are there 109K upvotes or am I blind?
*110k upvotes*
JESUS CHRIST 112K upvotes !
Thats more karma then I will ever get for a post
Having this at the top when this happens is ironic
Get this man a beer!
Exactly.
i vote for it
Indeed it should
Tumblr has it .
I agree.
I'm reading pro revenge and I have to scroll through 5 000 pages of already read stories to find new ones I haven't read
"And also a ""block subreddit"" button"
Just here farming karmas so that i can post ma memes
Give me upvotes so I can post a meme guys
Millionaire ideas
U should be a reddit employerConstantly giving them good ideas smh
I can relate af
Or just make it so it doesn’t automatically scroll to the top
Fuck go back
Tumbler has this it just does not work
Update: It’s 2019 and Reddit still doesn’t have this feature yet
True fact
We absolutely need that
They do for mobile
Best idea since Netflix skip intro button
"Hey quick question, ."
-- -.
"Yeah, nope"
Omg lol
Ha ha ha
*Reddit frontent developers sweating in php*
DAMN STRAIGHT!
Uno reverse card instead of going down you go up
We need this!
Exactly
Wait.
you’re not using reddit on the smart fridge?
this post just took the number 1 spot
Carefully.
he’s a hero
I remember seeing this MEME made by you a while ago when it only had like 6.
2 k upvotes and I upvotes congrats on a lot and I mean a lot of upvotes
People should really stop using garbage meme formats because they aren’t even creative.
I think it’s just a crappy excuse to put ideas of varying creativity on a place where no one cares about that.
We care about memes.
REAL memes.
9gag has it and it works perfectly.
Need this
And that's a fact
"i finally found this meme again, and yes"
We need a f**king  petition
Just a time gem in the top right corner
Yes I love it
Where do I sign
Creativity 100Intelligence 100
Found this at the top XD
Penis
My friend in reddit said they're actually working on it :)
Hurt my thumb reaching for the upvote button.
"It was totally worth it, and I would do it again."
###REDDITERS.
ASSEMBLE!
True!
fuck yes
What has God done?
sauce
Don't press back twice
Get out of here with your great and logical ideas.
Revolutionary idea
SPREAD THE WORD
"Yes, this has been plaguing me since day 1."
"Or just a confirmation like ""Are you sure?"
Facts
This is quite the good idea
Please ( pc users won’t understand)
So like tumblr
I literally just did that and this is the first post I see
Re-gettit
Tumblr has this function on its mobile app and its pretty handy
Legit just accidentally did this
When it still says vote
69th comment
Intelligence 100
First world problems
Literally accidentally refreshed to this.
Reddit is fun for android has this
Why does it take me back to the top when I try to expand a thread sometimes?
Haha lol
Yes please
Either that or make it harder to go back to the top
The only reason I’m at this post is because I just did that :(
Where's the petition I can sign?
More.
Turn.
Give this user a gold !
My girlfriend liked this one
Oh my God please.
Please!
A reedo button
Double tap the top and it’ll bring you back to the place you left.
Yesssssss
Just change to classic post view
Agreed
They should implement checkpoints and put one everytime you upvote.
Reddit is fun on Android has this
Tip: Change your reddit settings to not display any items that you have voted on.
Upvote/downvote everything.
You'll **never** have this problem.
Been doing it for years.
"After this, I went to my music and listened to Morcheeba - Never Undo."
Yes I just did that and this is the first thing I see!
Why is it even possible?
"Forgive my ignorance, but how do you accidentally scroll to the top?"
"The only thing I can think is accidentally hitting the home key or middle mouse drag, but those things have never happened to me ever."
Get an iPhone and tap the notch to scroll to the top.
Solved.
I wish I could upvote this twice
💯totally
Oh mer god your correct
literally accidentally scrolled to the top waiting for the image to load :)
please make this a thing
**Uno reverse card intensifies**
YEEEEESSSS
"Or just a classic ""Are you sure?"
""" button when you press refresh."
They should make the home button refresh the only if you hold it for two seconds.
Please reddit
uggghhh this happens to me so much!
I hate it
Its good to know smart people still exist
upvote so we get it
"I don't accidentally scroll to the top very often, but sometimes when I'm scrolling through a thread, I accidentally press someone's user name and then when I try to go back, I've lost my place."
*laughs in Apollo*
This guy should be president
"True, I accidentally unvoted a post, and I was looking like 30 seconds for it"
Give this man a sheild
FreeLacrim
Please
Yes plz
"*scrolling, scrolling* ""Oh that looks interesting""."
"*fat fingers'd* ""Shit."
Now its lost forever.
"Reddit also should fix save button, but seriously, am i only who needs to save post multiple times before they got really saved ?"
"I would scroll until i'm dead, that's a public health problem!"
It gets to the best of us.
"Call it ""Reverse"""
Or just get of the stupid feature that makes it suddenly jump to the top if you don't hold your phone just right.
If this doesn’t happen I will I get the most of these memes 😢
Tumblr mobile does that
R/foundthemobileuserohwaitiamonef
Reddit take note!
Just set in options to hide posts you've upvoted and downvoted.
That’d be easy I think.
Especially if this is react based.
Or wen u accidentally block a thread :p
Haha yes.
It's so annoying when need to scroll again.
Thinking: This is The end of my life.
Good question
"I fucking hate this meme, but goddamit this is an awesome idea."
Have my upvote
"Upvote x 1,000,000!"
I saw this after accidentally refreshing
"wow, Will Ferrell really knows how to fake juggle."
And he didn’t drop a single ball!
"Thank you for your gifts, this will be reposted for years to come."
Nice!
Now do Pams version lolEdit: the dude made it!
"As a professional juggler, this scene has always amazed me."
"Either Will actually studied jugglers extensively for this throwaway bit, or he's actually a juggler."
It's obvious watching this what tricks he's mime-ing (up until the impossible stuff obviously) and his hand movements are pretty close to on point for the 360 he does.
It's kind of insane to me that a comedy actor can nail an impression of juggling so much that even to an expert it looks believable.
This is the most amazing video I've ever seen
"Hey /u/Thori-0,This is now the top post on reddit."
"Creed is just standing there and thinking ""not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company""."
Now make him dunk from the free throw lineThis will soon be the top post in the history of this sub.
It’s a statement of fact.
Congrats OP.
Phyllis is the real MVP here.
Taking all those balls right in the face without even blinking
Quite possibly the best video I've ever seen.
Very well done!
Erin's reaction was amazing.
I fuccing lost it at Phyllis.
Fuckin fantastic!
You are an artist.
How long were you without Internet for?
Edit: My first silver.
It only took me 6 years!
Thank you kind stranger.
"I didn’t know I needed this, but here we are."
Wake me up
This is wonderful.
How did you do this?
After Effects?
I’ve never ever seen so many awards on a single post holy shit lol
I feel like this is what the internet is for.
As soon as I saw what was happening I was looking forward to the part where Phyllis ‘participates’.
Take my upvote!
"Edit: If you’re not watching it with sound, you’re doing it wrong."
Edit 2: My first silver.
Feels like a won a Dundie!
You are truly my people.
Edit 3: Well now I actually DID win a Dundie!
Thanks!
How long did this take you?
"The look on Phyllis’ face 🤣, and the sound effects 😝 ."
Now do Pam’s no hands version.
Edit:  I think this is the most awards I’ve ever seen on a reddit post.
Well deserved to OP.
My life is actually forever changed!
Thank you!
The best part was the sound effects coming off Phyllis's face.
Not having internet can do wonders.
OP please don't use internet for a year and give us some OC.
Never seen so many rewards before
Man when Phylis gets rapid fire decked in the face I busted out laughing
"It’s funny, when there were no balls in the original I always focused on him, but with balls I found myself watching everyone else in the background and noticed all their expressions for the first time"
I laughed so fucking hard at the Phyllis part.
I legitimately had tears in my eyes!
Thank you so much!
"This was magical an original, congrats on your travels to the front page, an the sweet riches of karma and gold coming your way!"
Wtf I've never seen so many awards collectively through my entire life.
I never touch another juggler's instruments - Wayne Gretzky
"i always forget that he puts evanesence on in the background for it--no idea why that song is so funny in this scene, but it gets me every time"
Surely I'm not the only one who watched this mainly to see him bouncing them off Phyllis' head.
Single best video on this entire sub
OP is gonna have premium for a long time
over 400$ in awards has been given to this post what the actual fuck
"STILL hate the Deangelo arc, but you killed it OP."
Somehow the Evanescence made it so much more perfect 👌
Amazing job!
I died when he started throwing them at Phyllis
Unbelievably well done.
I lost it when he bounced the balls off Phylis.
u/VredditDownloader
don't know the original scene and thought it was real right untill the part where he started throwing it at her glasses.
Bravo.
Does anyone have the real scene for comparison?
How the fuck did this get 80 dundies
Holy shit!
308 awards got damn
Incredible!
I wanted to see the original and didn't see it posted yet.
"but there are a lot of comments, could have missed it."
Here is an original version.
See you on the front page
Magical OP.
Take my upvote.
To the front page we go!
Can someone calculate how much money this post is worth based on its awards?
Incredible
This is amazing!
"Please don't stop here, there must be more uses for this amazing talent."
"I mean, not the juggling."
world class juggler
I needed this so bad.
See you all in r/all!
The part with Phyllis is epic!
Thank you for sharing.
I don't know why but the sound of the balls hitting Phallis' head really got me.
Initial reaction is just uh cool I guess?
And then the part where he makes eye contact with Phyllis had me dying
I've never seen anything gilded so much in my life.
And with such good reason.
"This is damn high quality stuff, OP."
well deserved.
This is the most awards I’ve ever seen on a reddit post
"I've never seen this show, was just browsing r/all and I saw this."
I legitimately thought he was juggling and was wondering what was making this post worthy of 100k+ upvotes.
And then after I watched I realised he was fake juggling.
Damn good job OP.
Is this the most gilded post ever?
"I did the math and as of August 3rd, yall have spent $522 on this post, assuming you bought the most discounted bundle without buying too much of that bundle."
worst case this cost $824.
What is wrong with all of you.
My guy got 5 years of Reddit premium for this one post.
# YOU.
INTERNET.
Dude I fucking died when he was throwing the balls at phyllis.
Nice job!
Now do the Swedish Chef!
OMG this makes the scene SO MUCH FUNNIER!
I have watched the series so many times and never laugh as much at this scene as I did just now.
Thank God I was already on the toilet.
Phyllis goes hard af 🥴
I lost all composure when Phyllis' turn came around.
And the look on Stanley's face in the background.
"Evanescence should just use this as their video for ""Bring Me To Life""."
This is gonna be the highest upvoted post ever on this sub.
I can smell it.
Now THIS is the quality content I like to see!
Awesome.
just please make sure you use your powers for good.
We don’t need any uncensored Meredith/Casual Day videos out there.
THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER.
Can’t believe no one has done this after the office ended years ago
"When Phyllis got the balls to the face, I lost it."
"The sound effects, especially the little \*pats\* when he catches them."
Where the heck did all of these awards come from?
Can someone calculate how much money this cost?
Isn’t this the original unedited version though?
Never seen so many awards in one Reddit post
Wtf 129k likes with 475 awards.
00 or 275 pts / $1.
37 dollars was spent on this post
522 awards?
Enjoy your 5 years of reddit premium
*Ding dong*
THIS IS GLORIOUS
That is just Great!
I think Deangelo can actually juggle.
"So many times I had to stop and ask myself, ""how's he doing that?"
""" then I remembered I'mma dummy"
Oh my god.
Somebody give them a platinum already.
OP thanks for doing this.
This was amazing!
Great job
The editing when he’s doing the weird moves in front of Darryl is absolutely amazing.
Incredible job OP.
Now I need to look up the original again.
Did he not have balls at all?
"I was waiting to see what was different, and didn’t catch on until he got to Phyllis."
Time for another rewatch!
"Very good work , man (Y)"
That was fuckin clean!
Well done OP.
This is amazing!
Thankyou.
This.
Incredible.
Round of applause for Phyllis!
I needed this this morning.
Thank you kind soul
Impressive work.
Very impressive
Wait is that the same actor from the LEGO movie?
i can die now thx
Holy shit this is good
Wow OC.
This is truly epic.
"This is, to put it simply, iconic"
This might be the best thing I've ever seen on the internet.
Feel that connection!
Hooooly fuck.
When he starts bouncing them off of Phyllis' face I almost died.
This is the best video I have ever seen.
Kudos!
This is absolutely legendary man.
Kudos.
This is the content I paid for
Holy fuck dude.
Throw it on imgur and HQG this shit
PLEASE DUDE ILL LITERALLY PAY YOU TO PUT THIS ON YOUTUBE
That was amazing.
Thanks
Make Pam juggle with no hands.
This is awesome.
I couldn’t wait to see how the Phyllis part would be.
Not disappointed!
The phyllis part tho 😂😂
"> _Oh wow, you weren't kidding…_"
"This is great, thanks"
I signed up just to say how beautiful this is.
Oh my God!
This is incredible and 82 awards are not enough.
91 awards.
That's insane.
That’s the most awards I’ve ever seen
I would be interested to see how you edit Pam juggling with no hands.
So much better with the balls.
that's what she said
Can I upvote this twice?
Bravo!
Ok next do it with Pam juggling a bowling ball
"Wow Deangelo, you’re really good"
This is somehow funnier than the original and I died laughing when he was pantomiming it.
Good job OP.
This is officially my favorite post of all time.
"Awesome work u/Thori-0, you made my day"
This is quite literally the greatest post on this sub ever lol
Now make pam do her juggling routine.
"You have a gift, grasshopper."
Please take more frequent breaks from the internet so you can provide us with this magic on your returns.
Incredible.
DeangeloDeManDeLegend
Holy shit it's even more awkward with *actual* balls.
Do you feel that connection?
155 awards on three hours.
That has to be a record.
155 awards?
Forgot about Phyllis's part until he said her name and immediately lost my shit.
Then the sound effects kicked in.
"That's actually really good work, great job!"
I legit thought it was real all the way up until he threw the balls at her.
Was prepared to come to the comments to see if anyone else knew how good of a juggler Will Ferrell was!
As soon as I saw this I couldn’t wait to see Phyllis’ part.
I was not disappointed.
This is amazing and very well done!
This is absolute gold.
This was more entertaining than the actual scene because of everyone’s expressions.
Wow it really is a good routine.
Most days I am convinced that the internet was a mistake.
But not today.
Not today.
Was waiting so badly for the part where he uses Phyllis’ face as a bouncing board.
very satisfied.
u/willt_7
You forced him to touch another man's balls.
JESUS CHRIST THIS POST GOT REWARDED
You forced him to touch another man's balls.
"Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!"
"&nbsp;******^I ^am ^a ^bot, ^probably ^quite ^annoying, ^I ^mean ^no ^harm ^though**^Message ^me ^to ^add ^your ^account ^or ^subreddit ^to ^my ^blacklist*"
You are a gentleman and a scholar.
"Wow, watched it without reading the title and was impressed what a great juggler he was at first."
"You sir, are a legend"
OP - I immediately send this to my wife and tweeted it.
"You know, this was one of the most cringeworthy scenes of the show (def worst than Scott’s Tots imo) and you made it a MILLION times better."
Thank you
Gold medal!
Will Farrel needs to see this.
reddit.
I know a family who just has Alexa start singing happy birthday to their kid.
That's how everyone knows it's cake time- a robot starts singing happy birthday
I love when my in laws sing happy birthday.
They're all completely tone deaf and sound like Phil Hartman as Frankenstein singing Feliz Navidad.
"They are also SUPER enthusiastic about it, and it's great."
Making everyone uncomfortable.
It is a weird tradition.
"I’m comfortable singing Happy Birthday, but I Hate being  sung Happy Birthday."
"Like, what are supposed to do?"
Sit there?
That’s showbiz baby!
">I'm a designer too*looks at shirt*No, you're fucking not."
My family loves it.
It is an event.
"No one misses it, we wait for everyone to get out of the bathroom, finish talking, etc."
It is 12+ verses long.
There is no escape.
4 part harmony or its amateur hour.
If you don’t skip around the room at the end you are a pleb.
EDIT: Verses Include but are not limited to:-Happy Birthday -How old are you-Whats your s.
"First name -May the dear lord bless you-May the dear lord reprise with fermata and harmonies -For he’s a jolly good fellow -thank you lord for giving us _____-3 CHEERS FOR _____ (hip hip hoorays)-spell the name out (GIVE ME A “(insert spelling of name here)” *crowd replies* “letter”-BLOW THEM OUT, BLOW THEM OUT-SKIP AROUND THE ROOM *twice*There are some other verses sprinkled in occasionally but those are the mainstays (and I may have forgotten a couple)"
[deleted]
"""I'm a designer"" *shirt with 3 lines of text and probably clip art cake*"
"Op, I shared your opinion until."
The gal I ended up falling for sang Happy Birthday to me in a sultry and beautiful way.
"She did this in front of a crowded restaurant, where there were people from work present."
"While it was the first time I noticed her in that way, I dismissed it as her just showboating her nice voice in front of others."
Little did I know that she was genuinely  interested and would later ask me out.
Birthday singing is now redeemed.
Edit1: I thought I'd share an update.
"We've been dating, then traveling back and forth to visit each other quite a few times (1800 miles apart)."
I have since moved to her town and we see each other nearly every day.
"Reddit, I'm gonna say it."
I think she's the one.
Edit2: Holy Moly!
"Well, this blew up."
"So, we moved in together and are making a go at this."
When you advertise your T-shirt on a reddit post
"I like singing happy birthday, and I like when it's sung to me."
"Sure, it's a little awkward."
"But as long as it's my friends and family and not, like, the entire staff of a restaurant, it makes me feel loved."
"Wtf is this post, why is this allowed?"
If someone says bot doesn't exist on reddit I eill just direct them to this post from nowEdit: upvote bots
How does copy and pasting text make you a designer?
Nice advertisement
"That's a terrible design, how can you call yourself a designer"
This is literally just an ad for the shirt
I recently turned 40 years old.
My sister invited me over to their house for dinner.
"I knew my family would plan some kind of party, but I wasn't sure exactly what."
She told me to come over at 3pm.
I came into her neighborhood from the back side of the subdivision (a way I don't normally go) and parked on the street behind her house.
"I snuck through her neighbor's yard, hopped the fence, and then casually walked in the back door and sat down."
Most of my friends and extended family were there and didn't notice that I had come in because they were waiting for me to come in through the front.
"My sister turned around and noticed me sitting there and was like ""wait a minute."
"I yelled ""surprise!"
""" and everyone busted out laughing."
"\> **everyone hates singing happy birthday,**  In my own personal experience, this is untrue."
"I know many people who love singing happy birthday - doing shit like trying to harmonize with everyone else, doing their own little riffs, etc."
Why are we still here?
Just to suffer?
I dont dislike it.
"I dont like it in a restaurant, but otherwise go for it"
You’re wrong.
Your tee shirt is wrong.
I’m not going to buy it.
wikipedia.
org/wiki/Abilene_paradox) ?
That's an ad.
That's the news.
This is an ad.
Why the fuck has an advert not been removed.
Ruining reddit.
fuck you for this shirt ad
redbubble?
monetizing a reddit comment?
OP is fuckin desperate
Really?
I love being sung it.
I don't know what to do with my hands etc.
", but I am so grateful for my wife and kids"
"My son has autism and goes into full meltdown mode whenever anyone sings happy birthday, so we no longer sing it for anyone's birthday  👏😂Edit: obviously the people replying don't understand autism at all so I'm not even gonna pander to responding to them, peace out ✌️"
Your edit is garbage and you should be ashamed.
I both like singing Happy Birthday and having Happy Birthday sung to me.
"I acknowledge there are a lot of people who are uncomfortable with both, but surely there are more people who like one, the other or both?"
My bithday is 24th of July.
Basicallay everyone is on vacation so I don’t have to have the office sing for me.
"And to make it fair, I do not take part in singing for anyone else."
I only go an nick off the leftover cale in the fridge.
Which we all know is the best way to eat cake.
Plugging your crap off of a semi funny post RISKY MOVE ILL ALLOW ITI just hope no one buys it because this is some crap I don’t want to see happening more.
I hope nobody bought your stupid shirt that you so obviously “made” in anticipation of this post getting popular
did you really edit in a fucking ad dude
*with the tune*“LET ME ACKNOWLEDGE YOOOOUR EXISTENCE!
LETS PRETEND EVERY ONE IS HAPPY!
"ONCE WE’RE DONE WITH THIS SOO-ONG, I WILL FIND AN ESCAPE!"
It made my 1 year freakout and cry on his birthday.
So glad we do it to appease the fam
Tradition
Oh what a coincidence!
OP just happened to be selling a shirt with this written on it.
Spam spam spam spam
This is a good point.
And that shirt is garbage.
It’s like the comic sans of shirts.
I wouldn’t comment on it if this wasn’t a blatant ad for the shirt.
"Which, as stated previously, looks like garbage."
You can do better than this man.
"""I'm a designer""*Prints T-Shirt with birthday cake and 3 lines of text*"
So this has been botted right?
"Its not particularly funny, and it's just some dude shilling his shirts?"
This is odd
Because we hate each other and ourselves
>everyone hates singing happy birthdayUmmm no?
Many people like singing it.
redbubble.
I thought anything phrased as a question wasn't allowed on this sub?
"> So someone asked for a shirt, and I already made oneWho?"
Who actually asked for a shirt?
I like singing it and having it sung to me.
Why would you hate it?
How is this a showertought
"You're no mediocre designer, you're a terrible fucking designer."
So this is just an ad or what
"2 plat, 5 gold, 8 silver and 100k+ upvotes bc of a t-shirtyeah right"
"Yeah, we should change it up!"
From now on the official birthday song is Photograph by Nickelback.
imagine getting mad because someone made a shirt based off of their joke
"I told everyone at work that my mom had a cesarian, and that I get highly offended if people say happy “birth” day to me, so unless they want to change the lyrics, I’d prefer not to be sung to at all."
So now every year they sing “Happy C-section Day” to me.
Sto lat Sto lat!
"You are totally right, today is my bday and I got a headache from all the singing."
"However, I loved it, because it was sung by the people I love the most."
This piece of shit is a literal advertisement?
"Mods, what the fuck sre you doing?"
Can you please gtfo as mods if you can't act?
Because the only thing worse is nobody bothering.
It's a tradition for young children that somehow keeps going into adulthood.
"If it ended after 10 years old, I think it would be much better."
Just had a birthday without being sung to.
I've been to the mountain top.
It's cash.
I could've made a better design when I was 12
Fuck off op.
How is this a shower thought
Can we get a family friendly version of this?
"I have to attend a lot of birthday parties thanks to my lovely wife, but wearing a shirt that says ""fuck"" would be a bit much."
"When family does it, it’s cool."
"When you have to do it at your office, it’s stupid and painful."
Unpopular Opinion: I love it when people sing Happy Birthday to me
It's the way you guys sing.
I bring my kid to birthday parties in Canada where she was born and where we live and it's so depressing.
"Slow, dragging."
they are nothing like the Happy Birthday we used to sing growing up in Brazil.
"Following the beat with hand claps, people doing funny call-and-response (happy birthday to you - HEY!"
- happy birthday to you.
"), extensions that the crowd participate in."
"When my kid hosts birthday parties I notice Canadian parents are a bit puzzled upon seeing we offer food for them (cake included), we have soda, sweets (brigadeiro, beijinho and cajuzinho) for everyone."
I love Brazilian birthday parties.
Petition to change happy birthday to country roads
"Joke's on you, I love singing Happy Birthday."
The sheer ecstasy I feel as I humiliate someone and rob them of an otherwise joyous day is unparalleled.
"I've tried everything from illicit drugs to being in a loving, passionate relationship, but they all fall to the wayside compared to the sheer bliss I feel as I shriek the words to that iconic tune like the sadistic peacock of a man that I am."
"Friends, family, coworkers, acquaintances."
"For every person in my life, I make sure to note their birthday so that when it comes around, I'm ready to celebrate with a cake and of course, that beautiful, terrible song."
"Unbeknownst to them, the cake is an afterthought to me."
"The real pleasure lies in knowing that they will never be able to fully enjoy the delicious cake, as the song will still be ringing in their ears like a Vietnam flashback."
"For years, psychiatrists have studied my mind, struggling to diagnose why I revel in doling out this specific kind of social pain."
"Finally, Dr."
Hank Scrabble managed to connect my sadistic hobby to an event in my childhood.
"It was my fifth birthday, and my old man was presenting me with the sweetest birthday cake you'll ever see in your life."
"That's when my aunt apparently had a mental breakdown, because she leapt across the table and began attacking me while singing happy birthday."
"My family tried to save me from her beatings, but she fought them off with supernatural ease."
"As she ripped the skin clean off my face, her song mixed with the screaming and ringing in my ears to create a gorgeous symphony the likes of which would make Mozart weep with jealousy."
Some say that's when little ol' Blemgus died inside.
But I say that's when my life was given purpose.
"I knew I was destined to deliver the mundane, yet unescapable pain that the song provides to all those who hear it."
This is why I write my music.
"""For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"" is worse."
Damn that's a massive turnout!
Glad to see the people of Hong Kong have stayed strong and not allowed the authorities to bully them into giving up.
Strength in numbers!
r/hongkongSpread the word
Well Done HK
SEE MORE:* How many people?
"*The police restricted the marching application and forces the organiser to hold a protest rally  in a park that could only accommodate 32,000 people."
"This forces all other protesters to be left outside the park, along to other main streets and roads, with other vehicles."
** What's the solution?
"*The organiser suggested a tactic, ""water flow"", which asked protesters to first fill the park area, then slowly leave the park to allow protesters outside to come in."
** Why being peaceful?
"*The government said protesters are ""rioters"" who ""have no stake in the society"", simply ruining their home."
Protesters hope to use a peaceful method to see if the govnt.
"would ever respond to the demands, and of course, to show that protesters aren't rioters."
"I look at that and I think ""those people may die for something I take for granted."
"""  It's pretty sobering."
I didnt realise this many people are still protesting.
I guess I'm used to 1 day protests that go nowhere.
Much respect to these people.
Fight for what you believe in.
I just really hope they’ll be ok
let's hope the military stays in Shenzhen and we can avoid Tiananmen II.
"Rooting for you, Hongkong!"
Be peacefulBe safeBe water
that many people .
where do they pee
"One country, two systems is unsustainable in the long run."
There are only two real endgame scenarios.
1) The protests are quelled/die down and the long term plan of reintegrating HK into the PRC goes on.
Or 2) Mainlanders start claiming the same rights as HK citizens enjoy and protests spread across China.
The CPC fears the second scenario more than anything.
"Right now, their plan appears to be to wait out the HK protests without intervening, but if push comes to shove, they will take Tiananmen II over mass protests and the downfall of the CPC."
Hard to see how a peaceful resolution can come about.
So what happens while this is going on?
I have to imagine the economy grinds to a stand still right?
Do people still go to their jobs during the day?
Most amazing dedicated people
These people are unreal man.
Amazing

What the hell is going on in this comment section?
"This is no joke, we’re fighting for our future, and our “leadership” is sitting in an office doing jack shit."
How continuous are these protests?
Are there people in the street 24/7 or is this like a 4 hour march and then they go back to their jobs?
Edit: thanks for clearing that up!
"No matter how brainwashed the mainland Chinese could be, they can't possibly look at an entire protesting population of millions of people and still think they're in the right."
How has this not caught the attention of the American government?
"We get involved in every foreign affair yet when the people of Hong-Kong peacefully protest against a tyrannical government, Trump is too busy demonizing gamers to stand up to China like he told us he would do so many times."
"Canadian here, currently in Houston."
You all are very brave and doing the right thing.
I wish all of you safety.
I hope they listen to you.
The police force claimed that only 49k ppl participated in today protest.
While this amazingly crowded scene lasted from 14:00 to the night.
"Surely more than one million ppl, what a shame for the police tried to lying to the whole world."
Good luck HK.
it's a difficult road but hope you succeed.
*Deng Xiaoping has entered the chat*
I support the people of Hong Kong.
Always makes me happy seeing people fight for their freedom and human rights.
Much love from the UK!
On September 20th lets raid the Chinese government- they can’t stop all of us
Never seen upvotes over 100k.
Seems entirely appropriate it should be on this.
Good.
The people are Hong Kong are breathing life back into the hope of freedom for all of China.
Fuck Xi and his brainwashing regime.
Wow only 100 people showed up today -CCP
So when do the tanks show up?
Trump is already on twitter declaring these to be pics of his inauguration.
"That’s a revolution, not a protest."
"EDIT: That’s a revolution in the making***, not a protest."
"Dutch news tells me there’s around 100k people, it seems like there’s more though?"
Stay safe Hong Kong!
But I was told by a Russian reddit bot that these protestors are the silent minority.
Bunch of pro cpc counter protests in Canada.
Fucking disgusting.
I hope Hong Kong achieves freedom
\#dontstop
Keep fighting the good fight
Never lose hope ❤️
"Police: ""Looks like about 15 people"""
Why tf are Hong Kong police against them?
Shouldn’t they join them?
Hope the HK government would listen to the voice of people!

Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?
"Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that force must be called in to win back our love?"
"Let us not deceive ourselves, sir."
These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort.

Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it?

We really need to always refer to them as *”pro-democracy protestors”*.
"Most Americans and some apathetic Europeans don’t know what they are protesting for, we need to make it clear “these are the good guys."
As an American I'm ashamed.
We're sitting around commenting and tweeting as a a quasi dictator is committing atrocities in our name.

What would it hurt them to say hundreds of thousands of protesters?
They would be more correct that way.

Maybe it's time for the people to take their heads

Your courage and determination is inspiring.
I hope the UK people take some notes before 31/10!
Deffo not the kind of butts I like to see at the beach.
Good work OP
#trashtag should never end.
Thank you for your time.
that drink looks super unhealthy
Y’all seen his comment history?
I don’t think this is a person who would do this
#trashtag is always on.
Now if only we could bag up all the jackasses tossing garbage everywhere.
Walked around 7 miles of Pikes Peak highway for the race to the clouds on sunday and people had tossed all sorts of cans and big gulps into the woods along the way.
Like fuck you to death people.
How fucking asinine to come to do a nature drive and litter while you do it.
Fucking human garbage sacks.
"I don't want to be ""that guy"" but looking at OP's comment history they don't come off as the type who would do this."
"Look at the hands - slightly half-cast, asian maybe?"
"Now look at the comment history with such insights like, ""Bottom line is gay community and the black one are taking things too far and this will backfire one day and again white people are the ones we're gonna blame"" - /u/nnaabbiill 6 months agoIt is awesome that someone took time to do this but I can't see it being OP with their homophobia and racist traits."
"Also the image quality screams ""downloaded from the internet"" to me, which made me suspicious."
People who throw cigarettes out o  the beach deserve to be burned by a thousand cigarettes.
r/detrashed
Fuck those smokers that use the beach as an ashtray.
What the fuck is up with OP racist ass fucker check the comments .
Really disappointedEdit: lmao first ever award thank you kind stranger
"Wow, you must've had a lot of cig breaks!"
"Nope, sorry."
Just dump all that stuff back out I guess.
"I'm not sure, but this picture looks like it was taken from somewhere else, like it was screenshotted, and that this isnt OPs original work."
His post and comment history seem questionable for someone who would go out and pick up this much trash
Is there some sort of history as to why it is okay for people to toss toxic flaming litter on the ground after they are done smoking a cigarette?
It is so disgusting and inconsiderate of both others and our planet.
Thank you for cleaning up those butts!
I can't understand why smokers believe it is ok to throw those on the beach where everyone else has to walk on them with bare feet.
#trashtag for a 1000 years.
Great job!
"I wish everyone would checkout OP’s *kind* comment history and stop upvoting himedit: I don’t believe in littering, and not to reduce the efforts of his labor."
"but damn bro, you could’ve made a throwaway"
MYDORIA!
I hope the mods delete this.
"I'm usually all for this kind of stuff, but looking at his comment history, no way in hell he was the type to do this."
Anyone seen this dudes comment history ?
Hahaha everyone upvoting is gonna wish they hadn’t
I'd like smoking to be illegal purely so I dont have to see the cigarette butts every where I go because you were too lazy to dispose of it properly
Stop with these fucking titles.
Everyone knows it’s “still on”
I appreciate what you're doing but I must say you have a very interesting comment history.
Trashtag is one of the best social media movements I’ve seen because it’s not just people virtue signaling or making funny posters marching around.
its people actually getting out there and doing something often times with others.
Great stuff!
I hope trashtag can set the example for other social media born movements!
Send those butts to TerraCycle and they will recycle them for you!
Awesome job Midoriyah!
I'm sure All Might is proud of ya!
Fantastic work!
Thank you :D
WHO in their RIGHT MIND would throw away a PERFECTLY GOOD bottle o' cigarette butts?
SMH what are millennials coming to?
Read somewhere that cigarette buds are the biggest polluters.
"Thank you, you are an amazing human being"
"Sadly, you can't do this in New Zealand with the new ban on single use plastic bags."
Ya otherwise you cleaned up the environment for nothing!
Please explain how a hashtag 'ends'.
24 awards.
24 awards to some racist prick who stole a photo.
Impressive.
Thank you to whoever is in this picture.
The racist asshole who posted this can go fuck themselves passionately.
People just now seeing this oughta look at OP's comment history and absence of any response to the 2000+ comments in this thread or anything indicating he actually did this.
It's the most highly decorated karma farming submission from a racist homophobe I've ever seen.
"And I'll take back the ""karma farming"" part if OP gives any proof he's the one who did this."
Wow good job!
Dude.
That’s a lot of half smokes cigarettes.
Can I Venmo or PayPal you for that bottle full of butts?
There is a fair value in that deal.
Yes virtue signaling on r/pics still gets you awards
Nope.
Trashtag is now illegal you're under arrest
Right on!
This is fuckin awesome!
That is so good what you did!
"👍🏻💯I'm wondering though, in general, after cleaning up, where does all this trash go?"
"If this isn't disposed properly this time around, it will probably end up in the ocean again."
Just curious about this.
"Good work, that looks lovely!"
Hope trashtag is still on?
You can still clean shit without the need of social media approvement.
"It's ok, no one wi be angry."
“Hope this is still a thing” “wish we can keep this going” getting really old.
Just clean up and move along.
Downvotes please.
LOOK its a trash train!
Good work!
Fuckin cigs.
"Who thinks it's ok to throw them on a beach, you know?"
Here in the US that's called prime real estate.
Everywhere else it's where the trash goes?
It will always be a thing!
That must feel good.
Then sad.
Then good.
Now sad again.
My God!
"That's so much, thank you"
Where is this beach located at?
"nah it's over, throw the trash back to the beach /s"
Wooooooo!
Wow you collected a lot!
Good work
"Oh my LORD, it's onnnnn!"
Will always get an upvote from me!
Where will they go these trashes?
Excellent work good buddy!
"Nice, there’s still a couple of good cigarettes in there."
Good find my dude.
Ceci n'est pas une pipe!
Holy balls.
"I do beach clean ups, and that's a LOT of trash."
"Hell yes, super happy to see this."
Hate going nice places in nature and finding cigarette butts.
also respect to you for that trash collection!
I have a stupid question.
What happens with all this trash?
Is it recycled?
Tossed?
Holy shit you smoked that many cigarettes cleaning up?
"nope its off, put all that trash back"
"""do it for the karma""If you do it and don't post it."
Did it ever actually happen?
You smoked all that while cleaning?
That bottle of cig butts grosses me out.
"The absolute lowest of the low, people who smoke and then throw the butts in the sand."
#trashtag is the best.
Thank you for your service
When I see shit like that it makes me cringe at myself that I use to be a smoker.
8 years free and it feels good
"Shit, man."
When I was a smoker I would at least put my buts back in my packs.
The world didn't need to suffer from my gross habit.
Nice job!
I wish everyone complaining about climate change would chip in as much as you have
"TrashTag is never off - as long as there are people who refuse to respect nature, we need warriors to fight back and clean the mess."
"Thanks for your amazing work, stranger!"
Edit: word oopsie
I'm so sorry you had to touch those nasty butts.
Goin to need a bigger wheelbarrow.
Is there an alternative to plastic bags?
That work as efficiently/effectively?
#trash tag should always be the trend
Trashtag will never die
It'll only die when we do
#TrashTag will always be a thing
Why does that wheelbarrow look like a fresh veggie spring roll at first glance?
People that pollute and litter at beaches should be banned from all public beaches.
"All of the signs and fines don't seem to make a damn difference so maybe these people shouldn't be allowed on the beaches, period."
u/nwordcountbot u/nnaabbiill
Why does everyone believe this photo belongs to OP with zero proof?
I went through their post history and I can’t tell either way.
but something smells fishy to me about this post 👀
"Cool tip from a smoker that doesn't throw butts if you are going to be like that you can buy biodegradable papers, the butt disappears in something like a few months"
It's always on.
"Thank you, friend!"
Gentlemen.
Thank you.
Y’all he stole the pic it ain’t his work
Nice buddy Now sit back a have a beer
That's hashtag-trashtag.
Some Smokers do that because they are dont think its littering.
Good work heartly appreciate that.
"No, you racist edge lord teenager."
Hey cigarette butt litter bugs.
You are a bunch of cu#ts!
It's never off.
Go green.
For my rock people.
Edit: I think go green is a weed thing but whatever.
"Look at this stuff,Doesnt it stink,How about you properlyDispose of that drink?"
Love seeing these.
Well done!
Lol this isn’t op.
Y’all dumb
I just can't understand people who litter
8 platinum for a repost.
Looks photoshopped
Smoking should be illegal.
Edit: Or at least biodegradable.
2nd edit: But mostly illegal.
This is dope.
"I love the beach, and I greatly appreciate what you have done."
Why are trashtag photos always blurry l0l.
I call phony
I will ALWAYS upvote a trashtag
I hope the only reason #trashtag stops becoming a thing is because there's no more trash to pick up
No way OP ever did this.
His comments are all racist and homophobic.
r/quityourbullshitOf course people on this sub never bother to check before giving away fifty platinum and a million upvotes.
Thank you so much !
Bro it's always on
do smokers think that cigarette butts just bio degrade?
"because they fucking don't, ever."
"Very nice, I appreciate your efforts."
Keep this going!
"As a smoker, I go out of my way to find a proper place for cigarette butts."
"As a surfer, I bring plastic bags to pick up litter every time I go to the beach."
It’s unreal how much I end up with.
People suck.
"I dont always upvote, but when I do, it's for Trashtag."
Totally on!
Look at that amount of trash!
Geesh.
Does not look like OC
Good work on picking up garbage OP.
Maybe next try and clean up the hateful garbage you’ve commented in the past?
Thanks!

I see a lot of drivers smoking and then flicking the cigarette butts out the window.
They're litter-ally the worst.
(Pun intended).
"As long as people smoke,  this will always be a problem, I wouldn’t go around picking up cigarette butts  , kinda gross"
This is a great cause but can we please stop saying “I’m not sure if trashtag is still going on but.
” why would it end?
I will always have an upvote ready for any trashtag post
Wow op has a really racist and homophobic comment history.
"Quite a few removed, but not really what you want to read"
"Dude smokers are the trashiest people ever, when I was 15 I had a job sweeping a parking lot 90% of the trash I picked up?"
"Cigarette buts It’s disgusting, smells disgusting, makes people who smoke smell like ass."

"Unlikely OP who collected that trash, but I definitely support the amount of people this picture will probably reach and continue to inspire more people to do it!"
OP is a karma whore who i guarantee you did not clean up this beach
What are the pretzel and the P in the gilding list?
And is this documented anywhere (I'd rather read documentation than have to ask!
#trashtag is always on
"Too late, trend over, empty out those bags now."
"This is nice and all, but I don’t get the point of using hashtags on reddit lol."
"In Twitter, it’s actually a function."
The butts must have been some serious work!
As long as people keep posting #trashtag I'll keep showering them with orange arrows.
Reminds me of Bnha
Always.
Nice job!
Its amazing how many people don't consider cigarette butts litter.
Thank You.
Seriously Thank you.
Keep it up - you are saving the planet
Well if you keep cleaning stuff just for the picture and acceptance of internet strangers than #trashtag will never end.

"Unpopular opinion:  While I applaud people's efforts and cleaning up trash is great, doing it because there is a clever ""hashtag social campaign"" name attached to it is kind of missing the point."
"Cleaning up trash should never be a ""social campaign"" or a ""buzz-word."
"""  It should be something that we all do all the time without a social campaign because it needs to be done."
"If ""trashtag"" inspired you to clean up some trash, great."
But why weren't you inspired before?
Will you still be inspired after the trashtag trend has died away?
"We need permanent solutions to the trash crisis and not just temporary, short term efforts while a hashtag is trending."
Did you know you can still accomplish this exact same goal without having to justify what you did with with social media involved the people who do this and don’t post about it are the real hero’s
Really appreciate everyone that keeps doing this.
But one thing that's kind of disappointing is that people are out doing this seemingly looking for the attention of the .
#trashtag instead of just wanting to do it because it means your own planet is cleaner.
"Should be something that we all want to do just so we don't have to keep wading through miserable shit, not just for the internet points."
What a lovely thirst quencher after all that hard work.
Fucking hippies man.
"me/hashtag/trashtag), fortunately."
These type of posts were getting annoying.
Perhaps the mods could make a flair for this so I can safely filter them out?
I think trashtag is encouraging people who throw away trash in public places to continue doing this.
After all - someone else will clean this shit up
That's a good looking beach!
Well done you!
"I see people dropping shit all the time, the teenage wasters in their shitty little hatchbacks always leave litter behind them."
Awesome!
"Well done , line um up"
"Neat, thanks"
"I am ok with #trashtag going on forever, TBH."
Just watch.
google gonna program robots to do this shit
"Nope, #trashtag has now ended, please do the right thing and stamp those trashbags and cig-ends back into the nests of turtle eggs where they belong."

Cigarette butts in a plastic water bottle.
Kind of sums up the human race in a way.
"Nope, please put it back where you found it."
There's still hope with someone like you :)

It never endsBtw thanks for actually doing something about the environment
"Nope, #trashtag is over and you're going to need to put all that back."

I love that trash train!
And that bud bottle.

That is exactly what the fight is about.
Put on the good fight HK!
It's actually funny because if Americans mobbed up on a police station and threw molotovs like I saw in one of these videos the cops would come out with automatic weapons and mow us down like fucking grass.
"In fact I'm confident American cops would have put any such mob down hard well before it got to that point, now that I think about it."
"I, as a south American, see al this drama from ""Americans"" about Hong Kong as an incredible hypocritical thing on every aspect."
China has a strict record of NOT getting involved in other countries policy.
"América on the other hand,has a awful record of meddling with other countries for their own profit."
My country was hit by decades of brutal extreme right military dictatorships led by the CIA.
"You don't need to guess which country I am talking about, can pick any south American oneIf you guys are to eager to defend self determination you could start by protesting the American occupation of large parts of middle east(other end of the world) for decades only to keep the oil flowing BTW."
Hong Kong was a British colony.
taken away from China by force by the British army.
Its literally part of China
This.
The Chinese state government already has a strangle hold on western business.
Just see Disney as  a perfect example of bended knee.
It's not about Chinese money it's about the caveats and demands which come with it that are in direct opposition to our democracy.
If HK falls then it's not so much we're  next as the inevitable absorption by China will be that much sooner.
You want to delay that sad day.
support HK.
"I know Redditors mostly mean well and want to support whoever’s been oppressed, whether that’s Hong Kong, or Kurds, or many other groups across the globe."
Certainly use whatever means you feel appropriate to express your support.
"However, in this connected and information saturated age, it is easy to overestimate the influence of public opinion and how much difference you can make against far away injustices, but at the same time also underestimate your ability to affect change closer to home."

"Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist."
"Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew."
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
Wouldn't it be neat if Hong Kong had something similar to the 2nd Amendment?
if they wanted to mount a defence they should have done so in 1997now is too late.
"yes they can riot, they can protest, a lot of good young democratic cantonese might diebut it won't change china's policy."
with their one belt road and their fingers in every pie investment wise i don't see anything truly revolutionary happening there soon.
hong kong makes something like 3% of china's gdp.
its a lot but for the communists in charge i think they're willing to destroy it to keep the rest of their grip on their country stable.
i know these aren't pleasant takes but its whats happening.
same thing with crimea.
russia ain't giving that up there is too many russians therealso there is a lot of mainland chinese in hk as well that want a non revolitionary solution too.

Okay.
for clarity sake:You try that shit they are doing over in USA you will be shot by the police.

Thats just North America.

"&#x200B;We see and hear of other nations/people who are protesting, have it far far worse, and are actually DYING yet the whining from this is getting really old."
Britain returned /what was stolen from China/ to China in 1997.
Everyone born in HK since then IS Chinese.
and is royally fucked.
"This entire scenario was anticipated some time ago, as its common knowledge there would be resistance to the change in paradigms."
"I have seen exceptional patience by the country that owns Hong Kong, because last time around there was tanks, and bullets, and blood."

because they will not permit China to turn democratic.
Some of us have seen this before.
SSDD.
2a prevents this from happening in the US.
Change my mind.
edit: false equivalence fallacy doesn't work.
Stop using it.
This shit right here is the reason we have the 2nd amendment.
What is happening in Hong Kong is a reminder of the importance of the 2nd amendment in the United State.
"The real irony is, Americans protesting with HK are actively promoting censorship, stripping Americans of their firearms, free speech, etc which will ultimately lead to an HK-esque America."
First they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.
have a 2nd amendment or end up like HK
What I find so distressing about the massacre and the events that unfolded is how much of a good job they did at covering it up.
not as many people as you would have thought even know this event occurred.
Now I'm more terrified for the future of Hong Kong.
The most horrific detail of this event is that they crunched the bodies to a pulp by repeatedly running over them with tanks and APCs.
Afterwards they hosed it down the drain.
Free Tibet.
Free Hong Kong.
Free Taiwan.
Free the people of China.
Fuck the Chinese government.
Keeping in mind that that was only 30 years ago.
China has some pretty serious human rights issues with it's own citizens.
Free Tibet
"Why can't China just chill the fuck out, honestly?"
They have an interesting culture yet they have to tarnish everything by treating their people like ants.

Now that would be subverting expectations!
"Long has my sub, r/freefolk, kept the forces of kneelers at bay."
By the upvotes of our people are your posts brought to r/all!
Give r/freefolk the name of good series.
Let us use it to remember what good writing is!
"Dany and Grey Worm: ""We are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts."
The dragon-roasted pork is particularly good.
"Ah shit, here we go again."
Ya fookin' kneelers.
"If you're hungry for more fantasy from an author who gives a damn about his fans, check out Brandon Sanderson: Stormlight Archives."
I think this should become a Wheel of Time subreddit.
They’re making a series and it’s going to be absolutely awful and I really want us to suffer together again.
This would be cool as there is that lord of the rings series coming out on amazon soon.
You have my vote.
Rooting for this so much.

"55k, PAY UP CUNTS!"
"I so much wanted a great speech before a battle in season 8, sseems like they forgot to bring the speeches for characters in season 8."
5 minutes ago this was at 15 k.
Now its 20.

I wasn’t able to see the new episode last night so I unsubscribed from r/freefolk to avoid spoilers.
Then I see this crossposted on r/lotrmemes.
I get the impression the episode didn’t go over well.
Aaand it's the most upvoted freefolk post of all time
LOTR RULES!
"""And somethings that  should not have been forgotten,  were lost ."
"History became legend , legend became myth."
And for 2 1/2 decades the show passed out of knowledge.
"Until when chance came , i happened upon the dvd boxset at the public library, the prospect of nostalgia emanating my curiosity once more ."
"Old age having mellowed me , I figured my time had come again to face a great evil ."
That HBO is how long it will take me to get over  my ire at s8 disaster .
"Can we unironically do this, I'm legit sick of the show."
Please god
IT IS HAPPENING!
"Gimly and Tormund and Ghost, the perfect trio!"
It's done!
DO IT YOU COWARDS!
Holy Shit!
This is actually happening!
Ope guess it’s a lotr sub now
I've got ten years of sick Tom Bombadil memes saved up.
"I've never seen lotr but i want to get into it, where should I start?"
Hold your ground!
Hold your ground!
"Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers, I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me."
"A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day."

This day we fight!

I'd be fine doing it now.

We are going on a Adventure.
So that was a fucking lie then.
Alright.
Looks like we're hitting r/arrow levels of desparation now.

Well that was a lie
Still waiting
"Now since it has 30k subs, it's time to subvert the expectations and keep it a GoT subreddit"
The madness has fully set in on this sub.
That episode was really good tho.
This sub has gone to shit recently
For my beautiful dragon queen.
"Throw in some action scenes with CGI effects and half the sub says ""BeSt EpiSodE EvEr""."
This happened to my friend.
"He had just moved into a high rise in Miami and got drunk, went to sleep in the apartment one floor below his."
"He’s a 20 something white guy, woke up on “his” couch to a 80 year old black woman who had thrown a blanket over him and was making him waffles."
He had breakfast with her and they stayed in touch.
She passed a few years back and he flew from Cleveland to Miami for the funeral.
I get worse welcomes waking up in my own house
"Happened to me in a flat I shared with two mates, also in Glasgow."
The guy had been at a party downstairs and walked into my flat in the small hours and crashed out on my couch.
I  came in from a late bar shift seen him sleeping and left him there thinking it was a friend of my flatmates.
He woke me up late morning by sticking his head in my room and questioning who I was.
Turns out my two flatmates assumed it was a friend of mine and tip-toed around him as they got themselves ready for work.
I found the whole thing as equally funny as this guy does.
"Honestly that was really wholesome and it made me smile, his laughter and the woman’s laughter and good humor about the whole thing."
Lovely
"Well since you’re here, want some tea and a smoke?"
That was excellent.
I had a friend who did something similar in the US (we are Australian).
He left the house to get more beer then came back and got confused about the house.
"He was banging on the wrong door and yelling at them to let him in, then decided to sit on the front steps and drink a beer to wait until they stopped messing with him and let him inside."
Then all of these police cars screamed up and he was just like wtf is happening.
The cops gave him a lift to the right house and he went inside laughing about it and his American friends were all horrified and said he could have been killed.
Crazy.
"Guy wakes up (gets woken up) and is still drunk, figures out his screw up, realizes how stupid he was and the house owners aren't freaking out, starts hysterically laughing about the situation ('cuz he's drunk), then says to the owners: ""I've got to tell me mates about this"" and starts filming ."
About the least fake thing on Reddit.
"All in the glorious Scottish accent (and subtitled for the ""hearing impaired"")."
Fucking brilliant.
fuck in Lithuania you would be stabbed for this kind of thing
Subtitles appreciated
Was in Scotland last week.
Lovely people.
Aurora Borealis?
At this time of year?
At this time of day?
In this part of the country?
Localized entirely within the wrong house?
"Not really interesting enough to be fake, it’s only funny coz the story’s told so amusingly, god bless the Scottish accent"
r/contagiouslaughter
Something Canada and Scotland have in common I guess.
Definitely woken up in the wrong house and got breakfast before.
This should be use in a tourism commercial for Glasgow.
"Lol- A town so friendly, they will wake you up with tea and a smoke after you break in."
Well that's truly a best case scenario.
"Oh look, a strange grown man in our home."
Have some tea and a cig and gtfo.
"At my college, we had a guy everyone called Random Couch Guy."
He was not a student at the college.
"We think he was a townie, but if you had a party, you could be sure that he'd be asleep on your couch in the morning."
Happened like clockwork.
Couldn't happen in the states.
Bloke would've been shot immediately.
gotta love the scots
Currently in Glasgow; can confirm that this would totally happen.
"Visited Glasgow recently, Glaswegians are great people :)"
"Ah yes, this sums up why I miss living in Scotland."
I don't understand.
"He left the party, took a taxi and went into the house that was next to the house that the party was in."
Does that mean the taxi driver didn't give him a ride at all?
r/anormaldayinscotland
I can't imagine making a video in this situation.
That’s the Scottish hospitality for you 😂
This is the most Scottish thing that could have happened
This happened in Madison WI and the homeowner called the cops and the cops shot him.
Is anyone elses reddit videos pixelating and going to like the lowest quality half way through a video?
It's doing it with my phone (app) and desktop.
The exact same thing happened to me.
Only I ended up at the wrong afterparty.
"Since the houses had identical layouts and I was a bit drunk, I never noticed."
"I figured it was a bit odd that I didn't know anyone there, but they were really nice people and I had a good time."
At the end of the evening someone put a cover over me as I had fallen asleep on the couch.
"The day after I was woken up by a friendly woman asking me ""how many eggs do you want for breakfast?"
"We (a couple of other guests had spent the night there as well)  had coffee, bacon and egg for breakfast."
Some time during breakfast we managed to figure out what had happened and we had a good laugh about it.
Lovely people though.
"If you've been to Scotland, this doesn't suprise."
They are genuinely the funniest and most charming people you'll ever meet.
The northern lights is my favorite part about this!
from montreal canada i send my respects to Glasgow.
"For a guy who was so drunk that he ended up in the wrong house, he looks pretty chipper the next day."
"If this is him with a hangover, I wanna see him without one."
This makes so much sense now.
My dad must’ve woke up in the wrong house 20 years ago and they have been keeping him captive ever since!
"A friend of mine did this, got arrested for breaking and entering."
These people are great.
Haha he musta been fucking paralytic.
God bless the Scots
I went to an apartment party with some Russians who were lifeguarding in Maryland for the summer.
Passed out on their couch and woke up hungover af to them sitting around the kitchen table speaking Russian.
"My first thought was ""how the fuck did I end up in RUSSIA?"
""" Dated one of them for the rest of the summer."
I was really confused reading the subtitles why he seemed so happy until he said Glasgow.
Then I got it.
Not in America.
Here you gonna die for that snafu.
I love how freaking hospitable and lovely those people were!
I know I wouldn't have reacted that way for sure
Lucky guy.
it could've been messy if they weren't that understanding
"Damn, wish we were this safe and calm in the states."
*Checks to make sure handgun is still in my nightstand.
"* Yeah, we're good, we're good."
"I want to move somewhere where people don’t shoot you for falling asleep in their house, but offer tea and a smoke instead."
That was really charming.
"I've found some random, shitfaced dude passed out in my house twice."
One was a guy who must have been in his 50s and lived in my house when he was a kid.
Came home and he was passed out on my dining room floor.
Second was a neighbor's relative who passed out right in my foyer.
"Anyway, no guns drawn or voices raised."
I was way more amused than annoyed or uneasy.
So Scottish.
"When I lived in Glasgow I woke one morning to find a stranger asleep on my couch - he had no idea how he'd gotten there - last he remembered, he'd been in a bar somewhere."
Thank goodness the Scots are the sort of people to laugh this sort of thing off.
I love how welcoming the lady was and that they were all laughing.
"If this shit happened here in NY, this guy would've been headline news for getting shot."
Sad not everyone can be as cool as people overseas.
"This guy looks pretty good after a night of drinking, i couldnt look that good sober as a judge"
You got to love that scotsman accent
This is great.
"You can tell the husband isn't *quite* as amused as the wife, but they were definitely understanding, and even hospitable"
This is how much fun your life should be.
"A friend of mine got too drunk, went into the wrong apartment, raided the fridge, and passed out on the couch."
He just got done serving his jail sentence.
Luckily they reduced it from a felony to a misdemeanor but it really fucked him over.
"This exact thing happeed to my brother and he was arrested, dude is lucky the people are chill about it."
Friend of mine did this once.
"Unfortunatly for him, the lady living in the house called the cops on him."
They came and grabbed him and he got to spend the rest of the night in a cell.
The local paper even wrote about it the next day.
To put the icing on the cake he had just finished his base military training.
Hahah!
My boyfriend did this and got arrested.
Those people are amazingly nice.
"Something similar happened to someone I know in the US; got an Uber home, went into the wrong house."
They ended up with a felony B&E because the homeowner wasn’t from Glasgow.
This happened to a friend in college.
He woke up on the couch two doors down from where the party was.
The owner was cooking him eggs and asked him if he had a rough night.
Scotland truly is a magical place.
Nothing quite like needing English subtitles for someone speaking English
Had something like that on a festival.
"Wake up in an unknown tent, like wtf."
Some other dude laying in the front section just outside the sleeping area.
"So I go like dude I’m so sorry that I took your bed, should’ve woke me up instead of sleeping on the ground there."
"He looks around confused, starts laughing and says “man, this isn’t my tent either”."
I'm so proud to be Scottish right now.
I'm tearing up at the national pride.
r/HumansBeingBros
This happened to me in Florida.
"And I was awoken with a gun to my face and a voice saying ""you've got 5 seconds to get the fuck out of here""."
I consider myself lucky that alcohol didn't get me killed that night.
People make Glasgow.
Happened to me!
I slept walked (drunk walked) into some strangers house they were renting in New Orleans during Jazz Fest.
I dont remember it but they told me the next morning.
They said they would've been more concerned but I didnt have any shoes on and I was friendly so they just asked me to leave until I did.
I've stopped drinking since then lol.
"From what my family tells me, this sort of thing is a bit more common in Glascow."
One of my old apprentices did this a few years back.
"Was blind drunk on a Saturday night,went back to the friends he  was staying with but ended up letting himself into a neighbours townhouse."
he managed to find himself blanket before passing out on the couch.
Apparently the owner eventually found it funny after initially losing his shit.
This isn't like.
an isolated thing.
I know several families from Glasgow that would do the same thing.
Of course it happened in Glasgow!
Why was their front door unlocked?
The military has a love/hate relationship with the internet
Trust me: most people in the AF know what naruto running is
"They don’t know the proper form, they are no match for us."
Happy hunting friends
As someone with no idea how the military works.
could someone get in trouble for taking a picture like this?
"I realize this is nonsense in this case, but I would imagine photos of an Air Force briefing are probably discouraged in general?"
"Just think, some poor airman had to spend his day making these slides and act this out."
It's probably a joke briefing.
We used to do shit like this when I was in.
Still beats a suicide briefing.
For the twentieth time in a week.
Area 51 Naruto running (or I how I learned to stop weebing and got a bullet in the chest)
"Oh no you guys, they're decoding our secret!"
Now we'll never free the Del Tacos!
"No way, they should’ve shown an episode of Naruto while they were at it"
Ah I see they're serious about preparing for the Area 51 raid
Why don’t we make false plans and tactics so that they have to go through presentations and stuff wasting their time and resources
"This is the true power of reddit, making the U."
military give ridiculous briefings as much as possible(edit) let's just say power of the internet seeing that apparently everyone lays claim to it
Ok what can we get them to do next.
ideas?
You should post this in r/animemes and get more karma
I'm Air Force and I absolutely believe this to be real haha
Is this real?
This must have been a nice break between the don't rape presentation and the dont sexually harass people presentation
"Were there slides on Karens, Kyles, and crusaders?"
they be taking the Area 51 raid to the next level
We live in the greatest time line.
Just.
"step back a little and think on this: The Meme about US military official giving a briefing on Naruto Running has now become real, all because of a Meme about invading Area 51 is becoming real too."
First real LOL Ive had IRL.
Can we get an r/photoshopbattles for the air force guy demonstrating the run?
tax payers money well spent
They’re preparing for naruto run war at area 51
They’re scared.
we got em right where we want em
Modern problems require modern solutions
No way.
is this real?
"Idk why people think they’re having a bad time, if I joined the military and I had to make slides explaining memes to other soldiers, it’d be my dream job."
Lol I'm sure this is annoying for them.
If 1.
5 million actually showed up they would be done.
The 100 to 5000 who actually show up.
easily handled.
The forces will likely end up having to supply water and medical aid and launch at least 5 rescue missions.
Y’all realize that someone probably made the PowerPoint as a joke and it isn’t an official briefing.
They are busy scheduling a SARC to come in for a sexual assault briefing.
dayum I cannot stop to laugh.
"GERNERAL: corporal, explain me now what a ""naruto run"" isCORPORAL: It is like this \*wheeeeeeeeeeeeee ah ah ah wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeGENERAL: Rolls eyes\* oh my gooood."
They're training to become the hokagae
That’s amazing
"This post made me make some kind of dying grandma with bronchitis moan and i fucking hate it, thanks for this"
This is why none of the other branches of the military take our branch seriously.
Soldier: Permission to fire Sir!
Officer: why?
Soldier: They made a tiger seal Sir!
Officer: Take em down boys!
I just love how their higher ranking officer had to demonstrate what a naruto run is in front of the whole class
Did you guys remember when the AirForce were a bunch of highly-skilled/intellectual nerds?
i never seen a post over 100k upvotes in top 24 hours
We’re 100% in a simulation & someone’s fucking with us
Sadly.
Running like that works.
You lean forward on your toes so that you almost fall over.
And let your reflexes move your foot to keep you from falling.
"(Without sticking your arms out like an idiot) Keep doing that to run decently fast but not sprinting,but it's real purpose (in real world ninjitsu not anime) was to be able to run for longer distances without getting tired."
As you aren't having to push off from the ground.
Looks stupid as hell.
"but if you gotta run 30 miles straight , it does help with endurance."
"Real ninjas weren't fighters, they were spies, recon, and basically a secure letter delivery XD."
Now shit just got serious
# THEY ARE PREPARING
Is your cousin SF?
Just curious.
I understand if you can’t say.
Is this not important information?
My brother is in the National Guard.
He says they'll literally kill everyone that storms the base.
what a time to be alive
Chest needs to be lower to the ground to be aerodynamic.
"it’s the Air Force, they GET to sit through that class."
"Well boys, we did it, area51 is no more"
You give out way too much identifying information.
Your gonna get him in trouble.
Oh shit this is getting serious lol
Bro does your Cousin work at Area 51
There's no way for u do a class bout nourto running with a straight face
"If I was there I would of been able to show them the real way which is casting a jutsu with hand signs first before starting the run, details are important, or else when people do an actual naruto run, the guards will get taken by surprise and actually shoot"
Please keep this discussion civil.
"Threatening violence and harassment towards anyone is not cool, and any further similar behaviour will result in banning and locking."
I got copyright claimed for a song in the public domain
"This shit happens so often, and they wonder why so many hate YouTube."
"The only way to protect yourself from companies like this is make your own shell company and claim all your videos, then funnel all your earnings through there."
Upload some random pink/white noise and see if it gets flagged.
If it does then you could may by counter sue the people who did this?
Cause it could be considered some kinda security / denial of service attack and disruption against a legal company.
Which iirc is criminal rather then civil in most places.
But good luck getting somebody to act on it though.
♪ *Mumbo Mumbo you are AFK.

"Fuck, Mumbo is one of the best mc youtubers imo"
I had something similar happen : YouTube (Amazon will do this too!
) will always side with the claimant and the onys of proof is upon the defendant.
Some small Amazon distributors have been put out of business by rivals posting multiple baseless claims.
That's our modern social media system.
Cross post on different platforms brother.
Protect your content.
Don't rely on Big Brother  :-)
"What I don't understand is, some claims are years after the content was created AND copyrighted."
"In these cases, YTs AI should already know  the claims are baseless and illegal."
Also YT should never allow auto-claims.
"They must all be done by a traceable individual, not a bot."

Just let him make crazy red stone stuff and leave him alone!
NOOOOOOOOOO NOT MUMBOOOO
"""How dare you fight off their claims?"
This is your first strike.
"Third strike and your account is banned permanently"""
Wait Mumbo Jumbo?
This is a Minecraft YouTuber!
And an old one!
The way YouTube designs this comes of as assholeish because.
**it absolutely is to the little guy** and (unfortunately) it has to be that way until the legal system modernizes more.
The system itself is there to protect YouTube from the legal system and not content creators.
"It's an interesting problem and I'm not sure where the blame should lie or focus needs to be, according to my Google search (shhhh) 300 hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube every minute which is something that's impossible to comb through manually."
It gets even worse when you have to then manage what is illegal on the platform and what isn't.
"**As a developer I empathize with YouTube as it's a data problem combined with a legal one**, they have to make a choice between:1."
The automated system occasionally targets content creators2.
"They break the law in numerous countriesFrom a cost point of view, they'll always pick option number 1 as it's cheaper every time and doesn't (potentially) put the CEOs in jail."
programmableweb.
"**In this instance though, an automated button for the content creator would be handy."
"****TL;DR** I wouldn't want to be the person trying to design and build a system that manages copyright for YouTube, sounds like a nightmare."
This guy makes Minecraft videos.
"Why, YT?"
"I said it 100 times, I'll say it again."
"Right now is the WORST time to become, or attempt to become, a successful youtuber."
Has anyone noticed less and less ads play on videos in general?
YouTube is becoming a garbage fire for those trying to thrive on the platform.
"Seriously, every time I hear about someone I know wanting to do youtube videos, the first thing I tell them is ""I hope you're not trying to make money from it"""
YouTube should add a monetary penalty to frivolous claims.
Something like $50 per claim.
Then split the penalty with the original content creator with YouTube getting 10-15% and the creator getting the rest.
YouTube would make extra money and the creator would be made whole for the revenue they lose while fighting the claim.
It would also reduce these ridiculous claims as no one will want to pay thousands of dollars when they have no real claim to the content.
"One of these days YouTube is just gonna go ""yeah we're discriminating against creators wtf are you guys gonna do about it?"

I WAS BINGING HIS HERMITCRAFT SERIES YESTERDAY!
TheFatRat received a copy strike on a video which contained a copyrighted song.
the song was produced by him.
"he recently had his channel terminated for absolutely no reason at all too, but gladly managed to reinstate it."
Youtube's system is so broken yet they do shit to fix it.
One of my favourite YouTubers :(He just plays Minecraft come on YouTube!
r/YouTubesucks
"Susan Wojcicki: nope, this seems about right"
It'd be better if there was some more video sites that were as popular to upload to
i love this guys vids especially on the hermit craft server.
i hope it doesnt get taken down 😪
F in the chat for Mumbo
"Yeah, if he doesn't fight each and every single one of them, then the company can claim copyright on them."
(Not contesting a claim is admitting fault.
"YouTube is such a shitty platform, but has no competitors so people have to use it."
Feel bad for the guy.
"Everyone should just use Pornhub, instead of YouTube."
"After a ban on some gun content, one channel moved everything over to pornhub so they could keep their videos up."
I find it disappointing that a porn company has significantly better management than a multi-hundred billion dollar company.
"Aaaaaah, that copyright may be due to the song you were humming in your mind dude."
Google knows everything lol 😜
"I'm convinced that Youtube allows such behavior, maybe even encourages it, to avoid paying ad revenue to Youtubers."
"If it brings profit to the company, without consequences, executives are fine with it."
This sucks because Mumbo Jumbo puts a lot of effort into his videos.
But if a company steals your stuff you can't do shit unless you're willing to burn a disproportionate amount of time and money.
Google has refused to comment on the plague that is Youtube.
There are people making fake companies just to make false copywrite claims to make money off of it.
Mumbo has been using the two same damn songs throughout his whole YouTube career.
YouTube is so broken now
"Hey, I watch Mumbo Jumbo."
Good channel imo
wikipedia.
org/wiki/Warner_Chappell_Music
Where did ProleteR get the samples from in his songs?
It's entirely possible that he used an uncleared sample from a song owned by Warner Chappell music.
youtube.
of which Warner Chappell Music is a division.
Mumbo Jumbo > NASA engineers
"This happened to Cdawg VA, too."
"Please not Mumbo Jumbo, Hermitcraft is my childhood!"
YouTube is good but an asshole design
Here I am thinking Mumbo was safe from it.
Nooo I love mumbo!
"Nooooooo, not Mumbo :("
I hope mumbo can get this fixed
"Oh stay away from Mumbo, I watched this guy so much when I was younger, this is horrible"
But my hermitcraft videos!
I used to watch that guy all the time!
They’re doing this to Mumbo!
He’s such a great content creator.
What if we just made a new Youtube alternative that is like the old Youtube?
Ye know the 2008ish youtube where vids could still be 3 minutes long without needing to perform hoops to come up in the algorithm.
Or when youtube didn't massively flagged everything.
New Youtube keeps grinding my gears in more ways than one.
Solution: make it cost $20 to submit a copyright claim
"I work with smaller creators to deal with these claims, and man, fuck Warner Chappell."
I've spoken with some people who work at WMG in their copyright enforcement division.
"None of them have any legal expertise, or any real idea what they are doing."
"I can almost guarantee that what happened here was someone at WMG hearing Mumbo's intro song, thinking ""I think he sampled this from one of our songs but I don't know which one"", going into their dashboard, pulling his video, grabbing the audio snippet from the first 5 seconds, and adding it to their claimed library."
No my man Mumbojumbo.
He taught me everything I know about minecraft red stone :(
Wait Mumbo?
Mumbo Jumbo?
The Minecraft redstone guy?
But sometimes he doesn't even use music in his videos wtf!
"Pray for Mumbo, he’s a good dude who makes Minecraft videos and is a genuinely positive person."
The artist of the music he licensed for his intro/outro - ( the music that's getting copy right claimed by this company) - used samples from this company.
"Unfortunately, Mumbo may have been using copyrighted music for the past 6 years."
"Oh man, Mumbo Jumbo got dragged into this?"
I used to watch that guy a lot.
One of the nicest people I've seen on YouTube.
This means war.
Congrats on getting the **top post of the entire month** in r/assholedesign and **#3 top post of the day** in r/all.
That's pretty big.
Apologies if someone said this already but the company making the claim actually had a valid claim.
Here's what happened: Mumbo had full license to use ProleteR's tracks.
"However, ProleteR's license for the sample used did not include the way Mumbo was using it."
"Basically, ProleteR didn't secure sufficient use rights to protect his customer (Mumbo) from copyright issues."
I can't really fault ProleteR for this because copyright laws are backwards and unintuitive in the first place.
"That said, this whole thing did serve to point out and shine a very bright light on a huge flaw in the way that YouTube handles copyright disputes."
It favors the claimant way too much and making a claim comes with no risk.
"Meanwhile, the content creators (who generate all that sweet sweet money for the company) have no protection against spurious claims at all, and in fact, if they dispute too many claims (3) which turn out to be valid, bye bye account."
It's a big problem and needs to be fixed a year ago.
hermit gang
I blame ConCorp
"Shit, been watching Mumbo since I was like 11."
Sucks to see him get slaughtered by the broken YT algorithms.
_Mei removed from the game for controversial reasons_
This is the moment for all those Overwatch porn artists to step up for human rights
Whenever I see Mei I will remember the leader of China looks like a fat diabetic anime bear
"Mei: *If I'm going down, you're going down with me!"
I really hope they succeed.
It'd be so fuckin funny.
"Notup to date, whats going on between cn and blizzard?"
It's funnier when you remember that her entire character is to help the environment and China is known for having such shitty air quality that you can make a brick by [vacuuming the goddamn air.

Do this for all blizz games.
Only stream with appropriate banners etc
Breaking news: tf2 sees 200% players increase
How do I support this?
"Guys, they're just doing it because of the chinese pros, if the game gets banned they can't get destroyed by pro players anymore"
I’m from Hong Kong and pro-democracy.
Big thanks to Reddit for contributing in our fight for freedom.
"I have seen posts about Redditors quitting World of Warcraft because of blizzard, a game that they have played for more than a decade."
To me that’s say a lot about Redditors and their character.
Huge thanks.
"No, this isn't how you're supposed to play the game!"
"Hell, let's make all International game companies that are leeching off China's market to get banned there."
Don't forget that Tencent (chinese company) paid Reddit 300 million.
This site is probably in the same state as Blizzard.
"John Wick: ""consequences"""
"Companies around the globe investing in the Chinese market probably failed to realize they are not really investing, they are only appeasing the communist party."
"When shit hits the fan, there will be no legal way for them to secure their asset."
Law and justice work differently in China.
Everything is controlled by the CCP.
They literally banned a player for showing support for Hong Kong
PSA: Everyone posting and upvoting in this thread is subject to strict chinese observation.
"*oh wait, crap*"
"Update Notes:   Mei Gets A New Voice Line: ""Glory To Hong Kong!"
#BIG BRAIN#

"I hope it happens, it would trully be sweet justice."
They deserve the same treatment that they applied to the player.
"So what you're saying is we need to make some ""red v blue"" style animations involving all of blizzards content in support of the riots."
It would have weekly content of that nature like the 'Montley Riot Adventures' featuring various blizz characters doing stuff in China.
Would probably become some huge propaganda resource for the victims.
"Idk if you could actually get blizz in trouble, unless it's own employees made a positive comment about it."
"Either way, it could help their morale/ keep watchers informed."
"but hey, I'm just me & you're just the internet, do what you want."
OoooohhhhhhhhhhNow search for Mei hentai on Google will result in the China FBI (whatever they name) to raid your house
Holy fuck if this actually happens
If you do that kind of stuff all the Chinese E-Sporters who do Overwatch will be really mad.
Just replace the character head to mei like Winnie the Pooh tho and make him of him The game will immediately get banned lmfao
Chinese problems require Chinese solutions
It's a sad day when even the gaming industry has a geo-political agenda.
I always thought that gaming was one of the common bonds that brought us all together to have fun.
Blizzard banned Pepe and 👌.
Will Blizzard ban itself?
This is gonna be good.
Unironically genius.
Now let's do the same with Disney movies
Internet Historian incoming
r/HongKong would be proud.
"Lets also spam memes about how roadhog or torb look like xijing, if that worked on winnie it should work on overwatch."
they would probably just remove the character
Even video games will soon become protesters
Pleeeeease we need a LINE of cosplayers as Hong Kong Mei to get on stage at Blizzcon.
Please.
Can we get the guy who does a bunch of overwatch porn to do something with mei?
get it even more banned from china
"""A group of Blizzard fans."
"""4chan."
"It's 4chan, right?"
Hell yea I loke StarTreck!
Mei the force be with ya'll!
This would really be awesome.
Mei as a symbol for the Hong Kong revolution and against China the fascist state.
We should turn loot boxes and micro transactions into a pro Hong Kong icon somehow
Can we make Hong protests come up whenever somebody googles the name “Blizzard”
I do hope this works and China does ban overwatch.
Please don't stop people!
Your doing God's work!
I love this campaign to screw over blizz.
+1 internets to whoever started it.
Stand Hong With Kong
Now that's an epic gamer move
Fuck the oppressive Chinese government.
1989 Tiananmen square massacre.
Weaponised memes.

"Getting a game banned so noone that has fun with it, can play it."
Great.
"Winston with a Winnie The Pooh skin, but the skin is just a President Xi skin."
Holy Shit that's so good.
"Like I imagine that if this is successful that they'll just patch her out to appease their chinese overlords, but you can just make up memes about any character if things like winnie the pooh got banned."
What I would do is go after Warcraft Races.
Supposedly over 50% of their WoW playerbase is in China.
Imagine if they had to ban entire swathes of characters based on their Warcraft race.
COMMUNISM CONTROL CAPITALISM.
&CAPITALISM IS RULED BY COMMUNISM.
The funniest joke i have never saw before in my life.
Mei mains unite
Only people that can even post is the elite of china.
"Play Chopin, any."
Don't forget reddit took a HUGE amount of that chinese money just oh 8 months ago.
So is this reddit covering their ass on that?
"or does china actually want this to be an issue we all notice, is that why its all over reddit?"
I use Chinese game to ban Chinese game
Noooo I need Asian kid on my team at 3am
What's happened with Hong Kong and blizzard?
With the power of memes I can absolutely see this working.
I don't even play Overwatch but I will now associate Mei with Hong Kong
Well she is the fucking devil herself.
All those times I was frozen by hell
I am so proud of this community
I love this how many things can the internet get banned in China?
So far we have Winnie the Pooh and the NBA.
the skies the limit!
She thicc
It's crazy to me that we wre turning a digital persona into a martyr now.
"I, for one, embrace it"
I’m in
South Park’s episode on China (S23 e02) sure is topical.
Fuck blizzard for what they did to that hearthstone pro player.
You can argue that wasn’t the right place for what he did but Blizzard’s reaction was cowardly and pathetic to hovel at China’s feet.
"Fight Free For Dom, Stand Hong With Kong."
"I’m form Hong Kong, I just wanna say thank you."
Mei Glory to Hong Kong
Fuck China
Support！Fucking China！！！
We will never surrender.
Fight for freedom and stand with Hong Kong .
If this works it’s honestly one hell of a smart strategy
"hey, all the foreigners."
Thanks for supporting and standing with Hong Kong!
Because that's what heroes do
"Artists everywhere: ""I have been called."
"I must answer"""
Thx for supporting hong kong!
Overwatch is the best!
I dont think I've ever seen so many upvotes on one post

This is in top of all time and I was posted one day ago
We gotta do this with Mickey Mouse.
Get all of Disney cucked
People we have a mission now.
I hate China.
What happens if we all went on Chinese wow servers and started shaming their government?
Would they ban wow?
I'll do whatever it takes to make this happen tell me what to do
I’m honestly surprised to see that many other redditors still know about OW
lets get pubg banned in China
What would getting the game banned in Hong Kong do?
This is so stupid
"I’m not a gamer, but want to support this movement."
How do I proceed?
That shit is nicer than my apartment.
Probably nicer than my first house.
I love that Maya has a plant
Is there a subreddit dedicated to tiny houses for pets?
Pet the damn dog
"If reincarnation is a thing, I want to come back as Maya."
Maya's living the dream
This qualifies as an r/CozyPlaces .
OP please post it there they'll like it.
[removed]
no way my dipshit dog would stay in that enclosure
"Hey MTV, this is my crib!"
“Ummm.
what are you doing outside my house?
It’s you!
You likey?
It’s cute right?
Oh crap.
it’s raining!
You just gonna stand there?
Pet me already!
Too trusting of the world but such a beautiful thing.
She looks so gentle.
Pet the damn dog
I would love to see the inside.
This dog has a nice-r house than most centennials
This was probably a “dad who originally didn’t want a dog” situation where they end up spoiling the precious pooch.
I don't know if this is Britain but this looks so British.
I love it.
"""I'll only say this once, get the ruff of my property"""
Having a patio raises the value of the house by approximately 7k.
Boop the snoot.
This cabin could be rented out in Vancouver for 800$ /month to some exchange student.
Ah to be rich
That house will pull so many bitches
"Hi, yes, I’d like to be her roommate."
I have letter of recs
I wish I could pet her!
how do you get inside to clean it?
That is the most adorable thing I’ve ever seen.
It’s like a Barbie Dream House for pups.
This makes me so happy.
Greta needs some gutters.
Why is Maya’s cabin nicer than my house
No pets?
at least boink her nose!
"Aww, its by itself!"
Give it a pet damnit.
You sick sick bastards!
That's a good border collie.
Wow she looks exactly like my 6 month old collie x kelpie boy.
So cute!
Sadly I don't trust people enough to leave my dog out while I'm at work.
"Fix your pronouns, noob."
She looks sad.
"But like, isbt this a security breach issue?"
Anyone can get in probably and/or steal the dog ya know.
Or maybe he comes from a very trustworthy community.
This really warms my heart.
I would like to live there with Maya.
I would die for Maya
"Dang, her house is nicer than my apartment"
Aww she has a nice cover from the rain
That is so freaking cute!
Nicer than most air bnbs I’ve stayed in.
PET HER.
Amazing
Wow I share a name with an absolute GEM of a dog?
I’m awestruck.
Pet her already!
"""Are you going to pet me, or stand there in the rain with your camera out like an idiot?"
I really need someone to go and pet this sweet girl right now!
She deserves it
Maya has a better house than anyone I know.
I love maya and I will protect her with my life
Welcome weary traveler
She looked so sad I wanna cry
"Meanwhile, I try to rent the dog house and they want $1700 a month on Zillow"
Damn that's a nice pad.
"Walk by where, through his backyard?"
I wish every single dog had something like this.
What a lucky pup and props to the owner for being so thoughtful
This is where I would drink my morning coffee if I lived there and drank coffee.
Did hank adopt another dog?
It looks like you would have to deliberately walk into their back yard to see the dog?
u/VredditDownloader
This seems more like someone's back yard then something just randomly near a sidewalk.
Not to mention these days you can't just have dogs that can pretty easily just jump a short fence roam places.
"""talk to her while he's at work"""
"It’s a dog house, but I’m still jealous."
Thats a very spoiled girl and rightly so
Border collies are the best.
u/nerdyninjaassassin
Condogminium
The rain just makes it even more comfortable
I like that she even has her own house plant.
First thought.
how to clean?
Need a lodger Maya.
He’s in his back garden.
How exactly are passerby’s seeing his dog
This is like putting candy in front of a baby gate.
Don't tempt me.
I'm not beyond tresspassing for a well deserved pat and hug.
Excellent craftsmanship!
Dad: we arent getting a dog*dad with the dog*
I half expected her to be a cat.
"dogs don't much care for peeing on such rocks because of the backsplash, maybe a grass area in the garden / pen"
"My heart is melting, this is too adorable!"
This makes me happy.
This is the best thing I have ever seen.
Where's her satellite dish?
She looks terrified.
She’s just seen the mortgage on that sweet pad
Yo how much for rent?
"I would love to build something like this for my dogs, but unfortunately we can’t leave them outside during the day due to dogs frequently being stolen in my area."
That owner is sooooo Nice i wish I was his dog
"If I ever had the money or spare time to build one of these, I am sure my dog would just end up visiting the cabin once a month"
That guys dad game is strong.
"This child is adorable, and dad is killin it."
Time to go hug my kids.
I'm 29 and I want this guy to babysit me
That is a great way to encourage speech development
This is insanely adorable!
"Hand motions and tone perfect with the baby, too funny"
I love everything about this!
Lmao the baby is literally going with it.
You know what im sayin?
"baby is nodding, yea I do know what youre sayin"
I couldn’t get over how white this dude’s teeth are.
Nice chompers man.
This exercise will help him develop language skills very early.
And he won't shut up.
I do the same thing with my nephew.
I always pretend he is complaining about his mom and dad.
I am so stressed around babies lol that guy is str8 chillin
The kid is going to be a really good conversationalist.
"Eventhough he dont understand what some words his dad is talking about, he still able to continue the conversation so seamlessly."
This is a great way to bond and build trust with others.
Baby will be a great conversationalist when older.
I love seeing examples of loving fathers.
We need more of these!
Stop.
This is to cute.
He is so smart already and has picked up on so much in his environment with the hand gestures and interactions.
He’s giving dad advice.
Somebody get me pregnant
Looking forward to my first kid soon.
Seeing this video fills me with *determination*.
"Take your time, little buddy, but I can't wait to meet you."
holy heck my ovaries
I love the little nod they give after some lines.
Like they just said something deep as fuck.
r/MadeMeSmile material right here
You my friend.
Are an awesome dad!
This is funny and cute at the same time
"I do this with my animals, now that my kids are older, they mostly just argue."
This got my heart good.
I did this with my son too lol.
It looks crazy and cute but it's great bonding.
"My son is 3 now and wont shut up, just talks and talks."
As a first time parent its amazing to see how quick their vocabulary expands if you talk them.
I just imagined his side of it like Bruce Willis from look who's talking
I love the hand gestures.
"Kids first words gonna be ""know what im sayin"" ?"
I love the shmoopy picture of the mom and dad low on the wall behind them.
"Between that much love and speaking to this kid in full sentences, he will do fine."
Say hi to Ellen for us.
This is great!
"I'll be delivering our son, our first child, via c-section tomorrow."
I can only hope that he and his dad can have the same kind of rapport!
"Edit: thank you guys, and gals, for all your kind words, advice (which is very helpful), and well-wishes!"
We're very excited to meet our little man!
My OB has been in the game for about 30 years and tells me that he feels the 11.
"7lb estimate we were given last week on baby's weight is ""likely pretty accurate"", though the standard is of course, +/-2lb."
"When I asked about fundal height, he told me, ""I'll put it to you this way: if that were twins, they'd be big."
""" I went to the hospital today to have my pre-op bloodwork done and every single one of the phlebotomists and nurses said, ""are you having twins?"
""" I'm 38+6 and completely miserable, but also very relieved about the end being very much in sight."
My bag is all packed and I'm going to add my pillow to it in the morning (it's a throw pillow off my best friend's couch in our old apartment that is the PERFECT bump-buffer size) for the ride home.
"Damn, those genes though."
"Cute daddy, cuter baby."
Dad is so smooth with his responses.
"Also, the way the baby looks at dad while he’s talking is amazing."
[deleted]
This is why I always try and avoid talking to kids in a baby voice.
They are smarter than you think.
Still r/kindsarefuckingstupid but still.
This is adorable.
That man sounds very similar to Donald Glover.
"I wish I had my dad, he passed away when i was only 3 years old."
I dont even have any memories of him but I so how miss him.
I want to be the best of me for my future kids.
They're talking about the ridiculousness of how loud for no good reason plastic cake toppers are.
"That's why the dad says ""take it over there"" because you have to take it far away from ppl (usually mom) to be able to sneak a piece in peace."
So cute!
It’s so cute it’s making me angry
This kid is so loved.
It makes my heart happy.
That was adorable!
I have a family member who at about one year old had conversations like that all the time.
She is genius level smart now.
Full scholarship to a really great school.
STEM major.
Keep talking to your babies.
Fucking 10/10 dad.
86436775/10 baby.
Don’t tell my wife but this makes me want another kid.
This is basically me during 95% of conversations with people in loud places.
This is totally wonderful (and dad should be a model!
OMG this was my boy when he was that age.
"He wouldn't say much most of time but when I put him in his car seat and it was just us two, he would babble non stop."
I never understood hardly a word but would just carry on like I was having a normal conversation.
"Once in a while I'd catch him looking at me with his head tilted like ""WTF dad, that's not what I'm talking about"" and I knew I had just got busted."
Dad here.
My son did something similar when he was this age.
I was carrying him and he was babbling baby-talk like this video and grabbing my face.
"Finally, I looked at him and asked, ""what's up, buddy?"
"When he knew he had my attention, he babbled more, paused, and then laughed loud."
He did this several times and I realized that he was telling me JOKES like he had seen me do tons of times.
"It didn't last as long as this great video, but I'd give anything for a video of him telling me jokes before he could even speak."
"Adorable and funny  , brilliant combo"
This baby is so *goddamn* meta and I fucking love it.
"The part where the _baby_ nods and agrees with the dad, I lost it."
At 0:50 the baby is like I don't have words to explain but I am trying Dave I am trying real hard.
Now tell me what does Marcellus Wallace look like
My ovaries.
They've detonated.
That baby’s gotta feel so fucking empowered right now.

I'd definitely go to his funeral
Definitely the real hero of the Area 51 raid
This is the perfect meme to sum that up

It took 3 hours to arrest him because he kept naruto running past the tasers

You can tell the kid has been trying his whole life to become a meme.
Absolutely no self-awareness - in a good way.

9k upvotes.

Wow I see this post and it has over 100k upvotes wow
120k upvotes Nice
this escalated quickly
Must be the meme with the most upvote I've ever seen.
HOW DID YOU GET 136k UPVOTES IN 2 DAYS?
What a bad meme
We need an AMA.
This guy should get a Victoria cross cause he restored my faith in humanity
I love how a meme was literally born and made popular in a single day
I love how the subreddit went from noticing the man to meming the man to worshiping the man to meme the fact that they worship the man in 12 hours
"The guys name is elixir a 16 year old youtuber, give him some clout from that"
Yinkies so many upvotes
It was me.
Worlds best ~~boss~~ nuruto runner

Anyone post a link yet?
Looking for sauce
Patition to make the area 51 raid/parade a national holiday
That video was too perfect to have not been staged.
"There is a video on YouTube of the ""raid"" only like 30 people showed up and none of them crossed the gate not even an inch"
How is he getting praised for this?
You can clearly see him lumbering around while all the other runners remain undetected even by cameras.
smh my head
Anyone else kind of bothered by the obvious hivemind created by this?
The only good part of today
69 K nice
anyone has any video of the raid?
Hopefully that person uses the ninjutsu hand signs too to evade incoming attacks

Get my man on Ellen
"So, when I became 18, I snapped out of any teen angst I might've had."
"While I was in that stage, I was really hard on my dad."
My sister and mom were too — I think the latter doing so partially led to me doing the same.
It took me snapping out of it to realise that and I felt horrible when I did.
He was doing the best he could.
"He'd managed to provide a roof, money, and whatnot for two decades without so much as a ""Thank you."
"""On Christmas Day, I wrote my dad a note telling him that I now appreciate all he's done and continues to do for us, apologised for being hard on him for years and promised that I would never treat him that way again."
"It was essentially just a note to tell him ""Thanks,"" and I paired it with a ""No."
"1 Dad"" mug — because it had never felt right to get him anything like that before then."
He absolutely balled his eyes out reading the note and opening the mug.
"Because of that, I nearly did the same."
Then he came over and gave me a hug.
"It's the only time I can remember hugging my dad without it being a ""Goodbye,"" but rather just an ""I love you""-hug."
"It's also the only time I've seen him cry other than when our longtime pet cat died — and even then, he didn't do that openly and in front of us."
"Since then, he has been noticeably happier and our relationship is absolutely ten times better than it was."
This is all to say that I can attest to dads having it tough and being taken for granted.
Somewhat off-topic I guess but it was enough to remind me of the whole thing.
"There was more to it than I mentioned, like that he wasn't a paragon himself, but that's the gist."
"**TL;DR: Don't be too hard on your dad and let him know that you appreciate him, for fuck's sake."
My little Jack died this past Monday.
Had the little fella 19 years.
OP is correct that dog showed me more affection than anyone else in my life.
That sounds so sad when you put it that way
Getting a dog was the single best thing I’ve done in my life.
Entirely changed/saved my life.
"With that being said, DO NOT get a dog if you can’t give it a quality life."
The only time I ever saw my dad cry was when the dog died.
"edit, this is the first time I posted on reddit and it blew up, over 50 responses and climbing."
I can't possibly respond to you all.
Thank you for your kindness and compassion.
edit/edit.
"I have posted many times, this is the first time it blew up."
My dad loved our dog soooo much that when he walked out he took the dog with him.
I can’t wait to move to a bigger place so I can get a dog.
"A baby boomer dad once told me ""my wife doesn't care when i come home from work, the kids don't care, but my dog is always so happy to see me!"
"""Edit: whoa there, i didnt not mean for this to become a thing."
They have a nice marriage and she loves him.
He was joking.
They have a huge house and the dog knows he's home before the humans do.
"And it was definitely a ""dogs are the best"" comment rather than the ""my life is misery and woman are evil"" narrative that some of you are projecting onto this."
I have three dogs.
I also have a kid but I have three dogs.
This'll probably be buried but.
Dad here.
I'll tell you why I wanted a dog.
"Once my first son was born there was this sudden, enormous leap in the amount of responsibility on my shoulders and believe you me, I felt every ounce of it."
"Now, don't get me wrong for one second, mum's responsibility is pretty feckin heavy too."
Arguably heavier.
Not an argument I would make but certainly not one I would spend words opposing either.
"However, there is an element to dad's responsibilities that is kinda final and ultimate."
"I like to put it: when the zombies come it's not gonna be her at the door with a baseball bat yelling ""don't worry bout me!"
"Take the kids""."
I'm willing to admit that that might be in my head or even that insofar as it's real it might very well be my own doing.
But I know this: in seven years there's only been one bump in the night and I'll give you three guesses who went to investigate.
"A good, loyal, sizeable dog feels like an ally in fight you hope never comes."
Trying to break the cycle by showering my husband with affection and daily words of reassurance.
He’s not a dog person so I’m the next best thing 😊
"When my dad was in bed during his last days my mum brought the dog upstairs to see him one last time before he passed, 'look who's here to see you!"
"', was one of the only times I saw him smile during his final days, the dog got on the bad and lay next to dad and cried, he could *sense it*."
"Ironically my dog ended up passing away due to the same disease (albeit the dog version) as what my dad had, life is cruel like that."
Probably equally as true that men don’t like to overly display affection but with dogs it’s all right.
"It's true, kind of."
My earliest memory of my dad was when I was about 4ish?
I think?
I went to give him a kiss on the cheek goodnight.
"He caught me on the way in, held me at arms length, and said ""boys don't kiss other boys."
""" I have never since given or received physical affection from my dad."
"I have no doubt he loves me, but that was me as a kid."
But man did he ever love our dog.
He cried when the dog died.
"Cuddled with the dog, etc."
"Now, on the flip side, I know how much this affected me, which means my kid gets showered with affection."
"Every day she gets told ""I love you"" a ton of times, and she gets more kisses than probably any kid needs."
"Both my dogs know when my dad is home, they know the sound his tyres make on the tarmac when he parks his car, and the way he opens the padlock and gate."
Both start crying and jumping at the door!
My dog loves me unconditionally.
No matter how much I fuck up.
she's always there to lick my nose.
"This is fucking pathetic, but when the LL wife rejects me I leave and curl up with the dog."
I honestly feel more love from the dog.
Can this be boiled down to males hence “Man’s best friend” and all?
I have a crap ton of loneliness and my two dogs keep me on this planet.
and I am not a dad.
My grandpa used to have a little terrier named Beau.
"Despite all the times he yelled at that dog and said he couldn't stand him, we all knew he loved that dog."
"The day Beau had to be put down, my grandpa buried him out back behind his shed."
My grandmother said she had never seen him that sad before in all her years of knowing him.
"When I asked ""Hey where's Beau?"
""" my grandfather just quietly sat and stared off into the distance."
My grandpa was a hard ass and didn't show much emotion but I could tell for a good while that Beau's death really shook him.
stop understanding my deep seated problems better than me.
(Also currently snuggling a dog while my youngest yells at me to move then asks where mommy is)
They also don't cringe at our attempts at outwardly displaying affection.
Dogs are team players that never let you down.
Even as a young man I can agree with this.
I work on being social and connecting with people but in my experience women receive FAR more affection than men.
"On average; Women communicate four times more than men, per day."
and NO this is not a problem with how men treat each other.
Brené Brown (a researcher of vulnerability and shame) noted the lack of affection and the cold treatment that men receive from women.
"She found that the standards of being a ""Traditional Masculine Man"", or putting on a Mask of Strength, is a response to Women's expectations of them."
We all contribute to this.
The Truth is:We treat Men's feelings like we treat Women's sex.
Men like it when they are the only one that She chose to have sex with & Women like it when they are the only one He chose to emotionally open up to.
"Only when it is *""rare""* and you have to *""earn it""* does it have any value."
"If either side just opens up from the get go, we tend to treat them lesser."
It's weird but I see it happen all the time.
"So yeah, having a living being that shows us unconditional affection and wants to be close to us is an incredibly heartwarming feeling that we, men, extremely appreciate."
Couldn’t this be “men” instead of dads?
"Welp, now I want one"
"As a dude who agrees with everything here about men not showing emotion, I just wanted to add a point to discuss."
"Historically men have been the providers, the hunters and gatherers, the fighters, everything that would actually require a man to be tough, resilient, and able to hide and control emotions."
This is what helped make the human race what it is today.
"Now we are in a far safer and equal time period, that men do not need to act in such ways, but it’s so ingrained in us at a core level that it’s not as easy as just flipping a switch."
"It’s going to happen, men will show more emotion, but it’s going to be a natural progression and reaction to a changing world."
I don’t think it’s as simple as yelling at the patriarchy for it.
It’s simply human.
Men were what they needed to be to help their family thrive and survive.
They don’t need to be that anymore.
We will get there.
"As a gay man I feel bad for straight men, because I can express myself in “feminine” ways and it’s “ok” because I’m gay."
"Straight men should be allowed to cry, to complain, to dance, to show every emotion they feel."
"It’s dehumanizing to restrict someone from expressing themselves, just as it’s dehumanizing to categorize what expressions are “acceptable” for gay/bi men."
"I’m lucky to be a 25 year old and the a lot of the battles have been fought for me, but I want to reiterate to my heterosexual compatriots; you are valid, you have every right to express yourself and any person who calls you gay or queer because of it, know that you are challenging their point of view and I want you to REVEL in it."
Carry on my hetero-son
Dad here.
My teen kids hug me all the friggin' time.
I eat it all right up.
"Not meant to be a humblebrag even though it'll come across as one: some of the best families I know, the kids are affectionate to their parents (daughters usually more so)."
I dunno if that's a trend everywhere but I have it here and I really like it.
"Dogs just add to the equation, but the ""because/but"" part of this showerthought doesn't quite fit here."
And I'm honestly kinda happy about that.
Dogs accept physical affection without question.
"Humans, not so much."
I didnt want a dog last year.
My wife forced it.
Now the pup is 1 year old and she is the only living thing that shows me consistent affection.
My 3 year old daughter does on occasion but our pup loves me.
Wants to always cuddle me.
"Is always right by my side, gets most excited when she my wife tells her ""let's go see dad at work""."
I love that pup
Dads often don't want dogs at first because they know eventually they will become the ones to care for it for the majority of the time.
They also grow to love the dog because the dog ends up being the only one who appreciates it.
Dead serious.
"Wife makes me feel like utter and absolute shit, doesn't appreciate anything I do and hasn't touched me in forever or said a nice word."
Kids don't give a fuck how I'm feeling.
But my dog.
damn does he love me.
"And he knows if I'm really feeling like shit or need some positive attention, because he won't leave my side if I'm in a rough mood."
He's a wonderful little cuddler and I'm gonna be a huge mess when he dies.
"As far as my worthless wife goes, man she's gonna be pissed when I die and she finds out I left everything to the animal shelter."
"I was going to pay $4000 to keep my dog alive, I had $20 in the bank."
"Borrowing money from a company charging ridiculous interest, but I COULD NOT make the decision to put my dog down."
until the vet told me how shitty his quality of life would be.
So I put my dog of 12 years down and cried for weeks.
"Was the dog I bought when I graduated high school, he partied with me in college, went duck hunting with me, literally my best friend."
I was 30 and he got cancer.
RIP Philly.
Plus dogs are just amazing in general.
"Give your dads, brothers, husbands, sons and friends love and affection people!"
"It’s 2019, they have feelings and need validation and love like women do!"
Tell them they are smart and handsome and sweet!
"Ladies, you know how it feels when people genuinely compliment us?"
It’s like that for guys too!
I just like coming home to my cat.
I get so excited to see her every time.
"Dads don't want dogs because they understand how much work a dog is, that you are taking something's life and constant boredom of just sitting around because you don't want to walk it into your hands."
Look at how many dogs get left at adoption centres at Christmas by kids who begged and begged and begged but then got bored.
"You get a pet because you want to take the time to make its life better, a dog or cat or gerbil isn't there to make yours better"
"I once told my wife that if she was ever as happy to see me come home as the dog was, then I would kiss her first."
Plus one of the only times a man can give unbridled affection without being judged or considered unmanly is when playing with a dog.
I recently got a puppy after struggling with depression.
"She's about 9months, and a wonderful friend."
"I've always dealt with my struggles alone, so I thought a dog would help me."
"Just a few days ago, I had a panic attack for the first time in forever."
"I fell down to the ground, my heart racing, unable to do anything."
"No one was home, I was alone."
Until my pup came up to me and started licking me.
"There I was, crying my eyes out unable to breath because of her slobbery tongue."
"I was able to get to my bed and calm down, and she sat by my side throughout all of it."
"It was like she knew I was going through something, as she moved to sit right under my arm."
I love her so much.
I once complained to my wife that the only one who ever seemed happy to see me when I got home from work was our dog.
The next day I came home to find my wife and both my kids tearing around the house in mad excitement and shaking their butts.
The dog was pretty happy too.
Every time I come home from anywhere my dogs lose their minds.
They’re so happy.
"They bark, they zoomie, and they slammy whammy."
It drives my wife crazy.
I love it.
I love them.
"My family have never had a dog, my mum doesnt like them and if one person doesnt want one then there’s no way it would work."
"I’m moving out, and before anything else i’m going to adopt one, not only will i be able to give it a loving home and care the shit outta it, but i’m also depressed and i hope that having the ability to care for something will help me mentally as well."
Sorry for the small rant but i’ve tried to keep it short and sweet.
I always warn people about the cost of owning a dog.
Not the financial but the emotional.
"Just put our best boy to sleep today, worse than losing my battle buddy."
"It's mostly because men interact/play differently with dogs and are far less strict with them, they don't bond so much better, just differently."
"Typically it's the wife who visits dog school/training sessions, does training excercises and reprimands the dog if necessary."
"About 90% of our dog school participants are women and when they can't come and their husbands jump in, it is pretty hilarious how clueless and inconsistent they are when it comes to training / working with the dog."
As a father I've got a tip to get more affection: show more.
Don't care what others think.
Tell your kids you love them.
"If they move you to tears, don't be ashamed of crying."
"It doesn't matter your weight, gender,  ethnicity,  how smart you are,  if you have mental health problems or the poorest person in the world."
"To a dog,  you are everything and the best person in the world."
Dogs are the best.
"As a dad, I approve of this message."
I am not a dad but a guy.
"There is virtually zero affection in our lives, or atleast in mine and other shy people like me."
People just can't imagine how lonely it can be.
"And if I go looking for affection in a date or even simply introduce myself, I get called a weirdo or even a creep."
"All because I ""had the gall to speak"" to a pretty girl."
It is difficult enough to approach people already.
"If you are not a handsome hunk, society has no qualms casting men aside."
"But society also tells that you can make up for it by being rich or influential, even if you are old and ugly."
That is why I have very little hope in humanity and for myself.
"When every human being I encounter all day asks for something and treats me based solely on what I can do for them in that moment, coming home to someone who is almost blindly happy to see me, just because it's me, is gratifying beyond words."
Talk to a middle aged man.
"They’re so starved of love and attention that you will make their entire day, if not month, by just exchanging a few pleasantries."
"I've had dogs since I was 6, I'm now 77, and had dogs almost all those years."
"Mostly I've had Dobermans, many people call them velcor dogs, very affectionate."
"I've had women say me or that dog, I've never got rid of a dog!"
"Dogs are just about the only source of unconditional love, affection, and loyalty that a very large percentage of men will ever have or experience."
Not a dad yet but my dog is the only one happy to see when I get home 💁‍♂️
I don’t think so because Dad’s also bond with cats even though they don’t give any affection.
Dad’s just care for things
Which means that dad's/men need and want affection more than anything.
And we should give them!
Love your dads!
*hugs all men in this thread* oWo
I’ve been feeling under appreciated for about 4 years and I just realized after reading this that my dog died around then and the hole in affection was probably from not having her around😢.
Her name was Maggie and she was a big licker/cuddler.
I made a joke about this once.
"Men are worthless, no one cares about them."
"Even condoms, made for a man to wear, are ribbed for HER pleasure."
"Meanwhile, we feel nothing!"
Reminds me of an old joke.
Put your dog and wife in the trunk of your car for 30 minutes.
Which one is going to be happy to see you when you let the out?
I'm not a dad and probably will never be (girls aren't my forté) yet I can still say dogs are truly mans best friend.
When i get a house i will get a dog no matter if I'm 'alone' or not
"This is basically Hank Hill on King of the Hill: happily telling his dog how much he loves her everyday, but shaking his wife's hand in their wedding photo."
Also men are typically are not allowed to show the level of affection they normally do for dogs too.
Dogs are an outlet to give as well as recieve.
My dog just doesn’t understand how gaslighting and manipulation work
I have been licked infinitely more by dogs than humans in my life.
I am thankful for this.
Do you need a hug OP?
My dad was more on the stoic side.
Acted cold to our new dog for about 5 minutes before they became best friends.
I get tons of affection from my wife.
And I give my dog more affection than I think she wants.
It’s just an affectionate household I guess.
"they don't bitch when you ask them to lick peanut butter off your balls either, everyone else looks at you like you're crazyeven the cat"
Men bond with dogs because we understand dogs.
"That is an angry bark, that is a happy bark, that is a I NEED TO PEE whine, etc."
There is no 'You forgot the 6 month anniversary of our first vacation together and now I'm crying' bark.
Dogs are just happy to see you regardless.
"They don’t complain, nag, flip flop, spend money and have unrealistic expectations."
The amount of redditors being called an incel on this thread is hilarious.
&#x200B;That word really has lost all meaning
wow this really says a lot about our society
Well said.
"Life is perplexing, when you give so much to show your appreciation for those around you usually nothing is received in return."
There’s a reason why men don’t show there emotion often.
We are use to having to hide pain.
It's actually because it's the only excuse we have to get out of the house without the whole family following.
Gonna take the dog for a walk!
"Meh, I kinda just assumed that dads bond with dogs since they end up having to take care of the dog since kids are irresponsible af."
"Broke up with my GF of five years, it was a shitty breakup."
"I came home from work, and she had stolen EVERYTHING."
"I didn't care too much, until I realized my pup was gone too."
That devastated me
Sometimes humans give dogs more affection than other humans
I’m a guy who is well-ranked on any test for being emotionally disconnected and I teared up reading these.
"As someone who is on the verge of getting his first dog, I can confirm I’m already more emotionally expressive with friend’s dogs than I am with most people."
Unfortunately this is more accurate than I’d like
"Dogs are always happy to see you, never criticize, and always come when you call."
Korean dad's bond with dogs so much because they get hungry.
This is sad if true.
It resonates though.
My fiancé told me that he quit sleeping around the night he met me primarily because I made him feel loved for the first time.
He’d had an abusive past and had used girls only for sex until then.
"(His dad abused dogs to death in front of him, so no loving dog as a kid either."
") Both my cat and dog loved him as well, though sadly my dog passed away last year."
My cat is very dependent on us and cries when one of us leaves and is there to greet us when we return.
She even follows us to the bathroom and gets excited when we go from one area of the house to another.
I honestly don’t know if I’ll ever be ready for a dog again after the horror of putting my former little dog to sleep.
"The main post fits my dad, especially as he gets older."
"Mom loves him, or tries to, but he really only opens up around his dogs."
"He’s nearly 80, but acts like a kid when he gets a puppy (he trains puppies for other people)."
"I had begged my parents for a dog since I can remember, and finally on Christmas morning when I was 13 I woke up to a dog crate and letter saying we were getting a dog."
Keep in mind my dad was fully against getting a dog.
Never knew why We had to wait a couple of weeks to pick him up because he was just born.
We drive to pick him up and it turns out I was getting a beagle.
I held him in one hand the whole drive home.
My dad ended up loving the dog more than anyone else in the family.
"At about 10 years old his health rapidly declined, and the decision was made to end his suffering."
"My dad said he couldn’t be there when he put them to sleep, because it would hurt too much."
I said to him that I would be there for the dog so he wouldn’t be alone.
Made the 8 hour drive home from college and said goodbye to our first family dog by myself.
Dad says we are never getting a dog again.
"A year later he rescues another beagle,  two months later he rescues a second beagle."
"Fast forward We now have a 15 year old beagle, and an 11 year old beagle."
I’m just waiting for the call to be the person who has to be there when they are put down.
Not looking forward to it
I know a guy who has some kind of genetic condition.
He's been tested and yes if he has children they will inherit it.
He's already decided he will never have children.
"this also means he doesn't get to have a relationship, or usually just short term ones."
"One thing he does have is a dog, and he takes it with him everywhere."
< grabs popcorn.
waits for Al Bundy vids >
I thought I was rescuing a couple of little dogs.
Turns out I had it backwards.
"No joke, I felt my throat constrict just reading this thread title."
It really is depressing seeing how ignored men are.
"We are expected to ""suck it up"" if something emotional happens."
"I've never owned a pet myself but my friends pets ( ducks, dogs, cats,) have always shown a lot of affection."
"If we weren't treated like emotional tanks and shown more affection I could totally deal with ""sucking it up"" because I would know that in the end I have something to be happy about."
That hit home.
"My Golden is old (rescued after being de-homed from her owners going to a retirement home) and I make a point of telling her ""such a pretty girl!"
""" every time I see her."
She expects it now I think.
I hope that I can share that same attitude with my next SO but this post made me realize that I never have before.
Maybe I should have.
Only time I’ve ever seen my dad cry is when our dog died
Damn this blew up op's in for a surprise
"Its not just dads, its men in general."
My girlfriend sometimes complains I love her dog more than her.
I love that dog so freaking much and its definitely partly cause it loves me so freakin much
My dog died from tetanus years ago.
Broke my heart that I failed her.
Even when she was dying she still wagged her tail when she saw me.
Loyal to the end.
"As a man I can confirm, I can get unconditional love from two places in this earth:1."
My parents 2.
My dog
"Growing up, we (including my mom) would do everything to get our dogs’ attention."
They just waited on him to come home.
And we were dirt.
"It took a few years to be in the position to have a dog, but it was the thing that I looked forward to the most after college."
I didn’t have to share her affections with my dad.
"Except whenever she sees my dad, I am still dirt!"
"She doesn’t care about my husband much (we don’t have kids, plus I had her for a year before I started dating him?"
"I'm not a ""dad"", but a step dad."
"I don't feel close to anyone and my partners kids went away for a few weeks, when they came back it was like I never existed."
"My partner stopped talking to me, I was sick (still am) and this is currently taking a toll on me."
"I legitimately feel like suicide is a big option, I never get to talk about how I really feel or things that I find troubling, any time I have criticism and concern it's always met with silence."
This time it's complete silence but she's super happy with the kids and focuses on them.
"Last night all I got was a ""sorry""."
"I feel genuinely broken and empty, like I'm just trash."
basically.
I really need a dog.
Dogs always listen without judgment.
I miss my lil therapist
This quote is so true
"I thought you wrote that Dads probably boned with dogs so much, that scared me"
Dogs are for people who need to feel loved.
Cats are for people who need something to love.
[Not just any gun range.
Well that was dumb
I was banned from r/news for pointing out some of this fuckery.
"Looks like they cropped the video to hide the obvious North American Forest, and then dialled up the graininess to further distort the source."
Shameful work ABC.
Hopefully someone is fired over this fraud.
Is ABC the same dumbasses who showed a 12 gauge shooting a watermelon at point blank while saying that is the destructive power of a .
22LR rifle after Parkland?
IM IN THIS VIDEO
How should news stations be held accountable for stopping this kind of stuff?
What the fuck ABC
This should be illegal and large fines should be handed out if you're considered a news source pulling this crap.
I don't see the point in making shit up when there's already tons of awful to report on.
Shame on them.
We've hit peak propaganda.
"ABC had to crop out the audience and cellphones from the shot, so they knew what they were doing here."
I remember one time I was watching news footage from some vehicle driving through a devastating storm where trees were falling into the road left and right.
Then I realized I was watching like a 3 second clip they edited into one long video of the same goddamn trees falling over and over again.
"Like, that shit took some editing."
"Anyway, shit like this is why I don't understand when people make the argument of how legitimate their major news sources are."
This is actual fake news.
"Fire them, this violates some very serious journalistic principles of ethics."
How is this not all over the news!
"I dont have normal cable news sources so I am unaware if it is, but this is kind of a big deal right?"
I mean how many get upset and fearful when they see acts like this on news stations?
Why are they allowed to do this unchecked and at times unapologetic.
"Well, this is clearly the first time a media station has lied to the public."
I for one am outraged.
*throws small rock*Boo.
Edit: Thanks for the silver.
Haha I'm enjoying the whataboutism from the far left now.
"""But Fox News does it too!"
This is unacceptable.
Daily reminder Obama signed into law the ability to legally feed the American public deliberate propaganda through news channels.
This is the Jussie Smollett of news coverage.
Do they not fucking realize that by lying they’re just giving GOP reps ammunition?
Jesus fucking Christ the lengths dems will go to get a win is fucking sad.
What was it Trump called them?
"An ""Enemy of the people""?"
When you've got news groups pushing for a war with Turkey and encouraging mass shootings it's kind of hard to disagree with the notion.
ABC should be demonitized by YouTube for fake news
Reason number 572837161848 to never trust the televised American news.
businessinsider.
Jesus.
"I know people hate the term Fake News, and Trump misuses it, but this is the literal definition of Fake News."
"This is why nobody likes you, mainstream media!"
"CNN is also famous for misrepresenting things in the gun debate too;Chainsaw bayonets""Experts"" who have probably never shot a gunUsing shotguns to represent the damage an AR-15 doesTerms that don't existSkewed and misrepresented statisticsEtcIt's all part of an agenda."
"Too many people listen to the media and automatically take every word said as gospel, never questioning or bothering to fact-check them."
Just look around.
"They want you to see the world they want you to see, not what they are afraid of is the actual truth."
This is the media outlet that constantly argues about how unethical  the president is.
good job guys.
Politics is just a game and the news is a sham.
"Nothing is unbiased, and everything on TV has an agenda."
"Money is all that matters to any company you deal with, and anything that's free has strings attached."
I find the world to be much less disappointing when I'm actively aware of these things.
Why/how do liberals still believe mainstream media?
Can we just call this blatant propaganda?
That's what it is.
In the ABC aired video they deliberately cropped out the crowd.
This was on purpose.
Fuck the media
That's par for the course for the leftist propaganda outlets.
At least they weren't doxing their viewers or doctoring audio tapes like CNN or MSNPC.
This it the ONE single point I agree with Trump: America media is full of shit.
Even the most balanced and rational (according to their own projected image) media outlets are mostly biased sensationalism.
In this day and age how did they possibly think they could get away with this?
Mainstream media only interested in putting up any headline or narrative to sensationalize and smear anything that is not in line with left wing bullshit.
Fuckin ABC legitimizing Trump’s treatment of news organizations.
Fuckin stupid mother fuckers.
"I'm more impressed that someone recognised the explosions enough to spot the fake, than I'm surprised a news outlet would use fake footage."
*S L A U G H T E R  I N  S Y R I A*
ABC could learn from Reddit's  r/politics and r/worldnews.
"They are wizards at deceptive titles, headlines and edited videos."
This is what people mean when they say fake news.
Crap like this.
And people wonder why Trump always complains about fake news.
Guess Donald was right.
Fake news.
Damn that's pretty Syrias
Makes sense why they would call it fake news
This is a threat to our democracy.
Well that segment of the news lost all credibility.
One could argue that news channel in general lost all credibility.
Seems like a bad idea to fool the public when half of the people that watch are hate watching you to find stuff like this to say “see your news lies to you.
So Trump is right.
Fake news.
r/politics users will say that it’s actual footage and that we are searching for a boogeyman
"""We are getting reports of rape and cannibalism""""Oh my, have you actually seen this happen?"
"""""No we are just getting reports of it, and are reporting it."
This is what *so many in the media do.
~~All of them~~.
"The second news became profitable, *it seemed like the media stopped reporting it, and started ~~fabricating~~ selling it."
"*Unfortunately, sensationalism sells."
Not news.
Edited: I've edited my comment above based on feedback.
"I agree, not every journalist does this and there are some truly exceptional men and women who put their lives in the line to bring us the news, especially from war zones."
The only way to fight President Trump's claims that the media pushes fake news propaganda to further a narrative is to properly vett your stories before airing them.
Instead of doing this ABC elected to publish a fake news story twice (once at night and again the next morning).
"In a world drowning in fake news, I would hope news media would try extra hard to regain the public's trust instead of furthering the justification of people not trusting them."
Edit: at all the TDS sufferers here trying to discount valid points because people post on r The_Donald.
Not counting the memes/satire posts in that sub r The_Donald is without a doubt one of the best places to find the truth on Reddit.
Edit: Why do you think Reddit still has it quarantined after 5 months and prevents it from showing up on r all?
The other politic subs can't fight the truth so they censor it instead.
"Finally, some redpills for people outside of T\_D."
"Please, enter the site, and browse, you'll see titanic amounts of information obfuscated and straight up hidden by the MSM."
Disregard the ocasional meme and absorb the veridic information sprawling all over the place.
"There is a reason that people call so many news outlets ""fake news""."
Now imagine how many other lies and hoaxes they weren't caught on.
"Or were caught on, by someone, but the truth never got circulated around to you."
goodreads.
We are being lied to every single day.
I am genuinely surprised this has made it past 12 hours of being up and has not been removed or locked by Reddit.
Fucking.
Fake.
News.
Media.
Spinning web after web of horseshit lies.
The propaganda I've been seeing against Turkey in the media is truly astonishing.
They literally tried to pass it off as though all those tracers were being fired into a crowd of civilians or something.
ABC has quietly deleted the video but has not retracted the story or admitted to their obvious doctoring.
"This is propaganda to encourage war against a NATO ally, it's fucking crazy."
Journalism is dead.
"They should change the name of the major in all colleges to ""dramamongering""."
Knob Creek Machine Gun Shoot
Don't forget the earthquake picture from the other day.
The media used the dead children from that and pretended they had died to a bombing run by the Turks.
I know this might be weird.
But The\_Donald has literally been talking about this all day.
I'm glad that out of that echo chamber someone cares that the news is misrepresenting the conflict in Syria.
And you wonder why people talk about fake news
Did all of the Correct the Record™ employees get the day off work today for Columbus Day?
This comment thread is surprisingly balanced.
"They said the ones being fired upon were civillian ""kurds"" whilst the one firing were turkish soldiers."
"Everytime you see this shit, dont believe it, research it, then find where this mfs turn everyone on Turkey."
They even blured it.
so what are you saying it's fake news?
i'm shocked lol
"Leftists during the Iraq war - ""THIS IS MANUFACTURED CONSENT!"
The mainstream media is owned by corporate interests getting rich off of oil and war!
Unplug your televisions!
OCCUPY WALLSTREET!
The CIA and the FBI work with other deep state elements to overthrow peaceful brown countries and worked against civil rights!
"""Leftists during Drumpf - ""Guys we need to trust the CIA and the FBI."
Journalistic integrity isn't something we should question.
"If a corporation is going to have positive messages, of course I am going to buy those products!"
"""Go team blue!"
"The left, circa 2001 - ""Invading Iraq to stabilize the region is just an excuse!"
NO BLOOD FOR OIL!
"""The left, circa current year - ""If we leave the middle east it will destabilized a region that uh."
was never.
uh stabilized.
"""So in 2001 I was supposed to camp outside of the stock exchange in new york saying dumb things to the press, unplug the MSM who was manufacturing consent for war, vote third party and uproot our secret intelligence agencies, but since trump is LITERALLY a fascist we need to spend money on woke corporations, trust the media, vote corporate democrat, trust the FBI and the CIA and want to keep US troops in the middle east to stabilize it."
I think I'll just send $27 to my man Bernard.
Reddit is hiding this thread.
Nowhere to be found on the front page.
Coincidence ?
"Disney owns ABCJust reminding everyone the corporate connections, though this crowd is pretty up to date on these things."
"Still, never hurts for quick side notes"
Reddit does this too
Hmm and people argue that there isn't fake news
The fact that it isn't illegal for a big news source like ABC to air this is unbelievable
Literally fake news.
"Wow, that is embarrassing."
They want this war so bad .
But can't get use to believe them lol
So literally fake news ?

"I hate that stuff like this can happen, Just a few weeks ago my school was in lockdown for 3 hours because some kid brought a gun to school."
Something needs to happen.
The fact that these kids had to put themselves at risk like this is ridiculous.
I hope they’re resting in peace as we honor them for their bravery.
Today my friend was looking a little down.
(We live in Colorado probably max 50 miles away).
I asked him what was wrong and he said he lost his friend in the shooting yesterday.
I had seen this making the respective rounds earlier and asked what his friends name was.
He said the same name.
I described him and my friend said I was describing his friend.
I then told him about this.
My friend then became less distressed and choked out “at least I taught him something”.
Not looking for karma.
Just want to share my story and hope that you remember people for who they were.
Fuck.
some people are true heros
Not all heroes wear capes
"A dog got a statue for giving its life to save some kids, I’d say there needs to be statues for people like this but without telling anybody who the shooter was or if there was."
Just say he’s a hero who saved people
Wait another one happened?
I used to go to STEM but left 4 years ago for high school.
Unfortunately I knew both the adult shooter and several of the victims.
Thank God for Kendrick or more people could've been hurt or killed.
He's a hero.
It's a shame this happened.
What a fucking hero I dont have half the balls of this guy he gve his life to save everyone else.
Real life inspiration.
What about the other kids?
"Just a few weeks ago, every school in the state of Colorado was shut down due to a threat on the week of the Columbine anniversary."
"Less than a month later, we get one in the same state."
The STEM school is less than twenty minutes from where I live.
The Aurora shooting was five minutes away from me.
Columbine high school is a little less than half an hour away.
These are all in the same state and occurred in just a little more than 20 years.
How many more now?
"Remember Kendrick Castillo, forget the shooters"
We have to remember to post this every year so we don't forget about him
"I honestly thought this was gonna be some stupid ligma post but damn :,( we really lost a good one"
"adults have failed to save children, now children must save children."
Rest easy buddy 💔
God bless this damned beautiful man!
"I am mind blown by stuff like this, scary part is it has become so normal, we forget about heroic acts like this due to how desensitised we have become."
I'm glad that media at least isn't giving fame to the shooter.
"I still fucking hate it that the media feed the Columbine shooters so much fame to this very day  Still, it shouldn't come down sacrificing our lives to save our classmates."
"These events tear a city apart, they must find a way to stop it."
Praying for my aunt who lives in Colorado and has kids in school there

Legends never die.
what compels people to do these shootings?
what am i missing.
"i don't get the motivation, is it just happening more because these people are inspired by the news?"
or is there some kind of 4chan type of place out there which fetishizes shootings and breeds shooters?
"im in school right now, and i can't imagine wanting to harm the mostly strangers i sit in class with, they are just there trying to get degrees/jobs/etc, why shoot them?"
"Hey /u/dinotrainer318,This is now the top post on reddit."
Training to properly react to a close quarters ambush is intense in the Army as an infantryman.
"Kendrick Castillo did it with no training as a student in a classroom, he is a Hero in my book."
A fellow FRC kid and a hero.
My prayers to his family and relatives.
Does anyone know what team number he was for FRC?
I did it too and I'm wondering what team he was on
They bullied the shooter to complications.
This is actually horrible that the public school system will basically let this happen.
It's because the public school system is a horrible place for like 50% of kids.
"There's social anxiety, and bullying."
These kids are young and since they think they have nothing to lose so they go and do this.
"Schools can't just keep going ""bullying is bad mkay""."
Kids are still slitting their wrists and depressed.
This is a serious problem with the mental health of the kids in the whole country
This shit pisses me off.
I am a survivor of a school shooting and nobody is stopping this shit.
We see our friends lay down their lives and lose people every day because of this shit.
"I about lost one of my mentors, one of my friends about got their head blown off."
"I helped everyone get out and stayed in the back to make sure we didn't lose anyone, and I was going for the fire extinguisher as a back up."
I want everyone on this sub to know that we are a community of support and we love you all.
Stay safe.
&#x200B;Also - Should you ever been in this situation* Throw things at them* Use the fire extinguisher to blind them and suffocate them.
"* If and or when they go down, kick the gun away* Should they go down, break ribs and legs."
Go for the motherfucking throat.
* Save everyone you can* Keep safe* Keep your cool.
Thank you Kendrick Castillo
"Before we/the media go on our inevitable gun control rant, what about parents being better connected with their children?"
I believe they’re the first line of defense.
*salutes*
Answer this question.
"Why, do some kids want to AND are actually more likely to try to murder their classmates now than vs decades past?"
"(hint, the answer isn't ""guns""."
"they are a part of the equation of ""why are students being killed"", but it isn't the answer to the above problem, which is the root issue)"
"Genuine question: don't the teachers instruct you to not play ""hero"" in these situations?"
That you should let the proper people tackle the situation?
"I've no idea about the US, but this is what we get told in Sweden in case something happens."
"Last year someone tried to break into a (to me) nearby school with a knife, but gladly the doors got closed."
We got an entire speech from the head teacher about this and what to do in a similar situation.
I’ve been involved in FRC my whole time in high school.
We’re like family.
This really sucks for everyone involved.
"Rest In Peace Kendrick, you’re a hero."
Kendrick is a hero.
I wish he didn't have to be hurt saving those lives from someone who should not have thought killing people to let out thier anger was a good idea.
I wish a lot of things and sadly that's all I can do.
I wish I could make a change to all of this but no one knows how to stop it.
I hate humanity.
But also love it.
I hate the side that thought this was a solution to their anger.
But I love the side that saved lives.
"If I could, I would upvote this 1,000,000 more times at least."
"I think the best part of these last few shootings has been absolutely no mention of the shooters, their motives or their pictures."
I don't know if the media finally decided to stop glorifying them or it's just been an accidental but I like it.
"Sadly, I live only 2 miles from STEM."
These past two days have been truly tragic.
Earth just lost its best defender.
We will remember him.
I go to this school
You can never tell who's going to be the hero when shit goes down.
Kendrick Castillo.
Respect.
"From everyone at FIRST, we thank you for your sacrifice."
"The members of r/FTC, such as myself, thank Kendrick for his sacrifice."
"Team 4224, Y-Not Robots, will be commemorating him at our end-of-season banquet tomorrow."
"Thank you, Kendrick."
May you be remembered as the hero you are.
the fact that this is the most popular post on this subreddit makes me really happy
Gun free zones again.
if only there was a way to protect kids in schools.
At least he died a hero.
I hope we never forget him.
Why do people do mass murders.
Innocent people just die and they don't get to live the rest of their lives.
Just fucking don't.
Our children shouldn’t have to become dead heroes because of our ridiculous obsession with guns.
He gave his life to safe others'.
He is a hero
It's been a while since this sub made it to the front page.
Why just Kendrick?
Who were the others?
"Fuck, he has such an innocent and friendly smile"
"He was on team 4418, Impulse."
i met him myself at the denver regional.
this is just so bizarre.
"My heart goes out to the family, team, friends, and school"
Yh ok hes a hero but maybe he wouldnt be if this kind of tragedy was fucking avoided.
He died because of your bullshit archaic (?
) laws.
"Yup thoughts and prayers, lets all fucking pray that it will never happen again."
anyone wanna bet money theres another big shooting before monday?
Please don’t say F
This is sad.
Something needs to be done in our school system.
No child should have to die saving others while politicians get rich and not solve this problem.
"I went to school with Kendrick for a couple of years at STEM, from the few conversations Ive had with him, I can tell yo8 that he is such a nice person."
"It sucks so much that this happened, I cant even imagine what his close friends and family are going through."
Rest in peace
Dude needs 99999999x more publicity than the people responsible for this nonsense.
"Okay y’all can argue about guns until the cows come home but can we talk about the fact that students aren’t receiving proper mental health education and care, pushing some to extreme lengths such as shooting up their school?"
"Fuck this shit, the fact this hero is a hero is bullshit."
Teens shouldn't have to be hailed a hero for sacrificing their lives because they shouldn't need to sacrifice their fucking lives.
"But the people in power will put in their useless thoughts and fucking bullshit prayers instead of doing something of any fucking use cos mUh FuCkIn RiGhTsSsSEdit: thanks for proving my point, guys"
F to pay respects (respectful f)
Future generations will judge our inaction.
"If children dying en masses can’t generate empathy, we really are monsters."
"In the FIRST robotics subreddit, people have been sharing a lot of stories of what a cool and dependable dude Kendrick was."
The world lost an excellent person
I don't care what anybody says this boy is the definition of a hero.
Respect for this man here.
May he Rest In Peace
"I was in the room when Kendrick lunged at the shooter and gave us enough time to run away, if it wasn’t for him my classmates and I would of died."
Thank you Kendrick love you bro!
"Kendrick, you the man."
"I see the word ""hero"" thrown out a lot, but people like him truly define the word"
Fuck these worthless people who feel the need to walk into a school and shoot kids up because they were dealt a shitty card in life and feel that taking it out on others is the right way to deal with it.
People like Kendrick deserve to be immortalized for their selfless acts in these situations that should never happen in the first place.
Future lives and families are destroyed by one extremely selfish ass person.
Rest in peace Kendrick

I know several people that came from STEM I even know a few who know one of the shooters.
According to them the shooter was an asshole in the highest regard.
he was never bullied but was definitely an outcast due to his attitude.
"I have never met this man personally but yet again quite a few of my friends have, they said he was always a nice guy."
"Remember the heroes, not the terrorists"
First kids are very brave.
His sacrifice will not be forgotten.
If you have a FIRST robotics group in your area please visit them and join a meet.
I want to as many teens succeed as possible and FIRST is the escape from home for many of us like me.
And please check out his team 4418 on Twitter and show your condolences.
I used to be a part of team 3694.
The thought of something like this happening to someone ive seen or talked to at competition gives me chills.
You did good Kendrick.
Rest in peace.
"Spread his name around, not the shooters."
Even one shooting stopped because of a lack of recognition is worth it(of course we would never know).
He’s a hero.
If there is a heaven this kid got a VIP pass.
Hopefully his family can have some peace knowing that when everything was on the line Kendrick was able to stand up to the malevolence in the world.
Wait.
"this graphic was made by Trident Shield, a company that specializes in active shooter training for schools?"
So they have a financial stake in this sort of thing?
"Castillo is absolutely and without a doubt a hero, but I'm not sure exactly what Trident Shield is."
I hpe he managed to watch endgame
God fucking dammit.
I wish I could shake this mans hand and tell him he saved countless lives with his selflessness.
"Someone should find out what his favorite video game was, and see if some developer can put him in the next installment."
Yesterday on Wednesday 2 people form my school who were suspended for fighting were walking to the middle school.
On the way (BTW they were walking) a school bus driver thought they were suspicious and called the cops they were arrested when the cops found each of them had a loaded gun on them and both schools when into lock down so it is helpful people like this man here and the school bus driver that save lives

Thankyou for being a REAL ONE.
I LOVE YOU COUSIN.
Let's make H be like F but for people who died a hero
This happened in my school district.
Our school was putting on four one-act plays which I was designing the set for.
My play was called Lockdown and it actually was a commentary about school shootings.
One of our rehearsals was first interrupted and cancelled by the Florida chick that showed up and bought a gun.
The second time our rehearsal was interrupted and cancelled was because of this shooting.
We decided to cancel the play and send a survey theatre students for their views on the event and do a reading of them and have a talkback with and audience afterwards.
All donations that we got that night went to the Kendrick Castillo Memorial Fund.
We made ~$200.
"Damn, sacrificing themselves for many others is something alot of people (including myself) like to think we would do."
But everyone knows that what you think most of the time isn't reality.
"And it's especially obvious when this guy, someone who I, based off of appearances, would expect to be the farthest away from this situation, jumps into the line of fire to save other people."
"The least likely people tend to be the most capable for the job, and I honor him for this."
"Rest in peace man, you died well, which is all any of us can hope for"
This is it.
The all time top post of this subreddit.
This is why it took me 5 minutes to fall in love with this community
I would like to congratulate you on top post of all time here!
Are we blind?
**DEPLOY THE REPOSTS**
Why does this shit still happen.
We need to do something about this.
"Back with parkland something almost happened, we almost changed things."
"We need to do that again, and it shouldn’t take another parkland in order for us to do so."
Shootings like this are becoming buried in the news and that’s not good at all.
"We as r/teenagers should do something, anything we can."
Our voices need to be heard again

Look at how old he was: 18!
Why did we have to sacrifice an 18-year old to stop a gunman?
Stop this madness!
For god's sake PLEASE make teachers keep guns!
Daily reminder that Australia's gun buyback did nothing to the homicide rate and gun control bills prey on events like these.
Fuck US gun laws.
A true hero.
Do you live in Denver?
This happened near me and my school was put on secure perimeter
A real life superhero
"Sorry for asking, but what is STEM?"
I hope his family and friends know that people's lives were saved because of him.
And that he'd touched their lives forever.
That he'd go down as a hero and be remember as such.
Thank you Kendrick Castillo
"My guy gave his life to save others, respect"
Fuck man.
Good on him.
Wish I coulda knew him
"""STEM gunman"" is a terrible title for a terrorist"
Wait what happened at STEM?
When was this?
STEM highschool is literally a few miles from my school.
Alan from New Zealand.
I now know his name.
"I am both angry at and sorry for your loss,"
so how many Kendricks so far this year?
"Stories like this are the hardest to hear, they're just kids man, my age."
Thank you for posting this.
We should remember him and heroes like him and not focus on the perps in these situations.
"If it weren’t for Kendrick Castillo, many more students could have been killed."
"Thank you, Kendrick, for your selfless sacrifice that you should not have had to make."
It hurts my heart so much every time I have to read another one of these stories.
We lost a truly kind soul to such a selfless actRIP Kendrick Castillo
RIP Kendrick.
I'm in awe of the size of his bravery
Kendrick.
You will go down as a hero
"After reading through a few articles, I'm glad that many have started talking about the victims of the shootings rather than focusing on the shooter."
"They all went more into detail as to who Kendrick was, which I found pretty sweet."
"With that said, it angers me that kids are subjected to this reality."
No one should go to school wondering if they will be the next victims.
Something should be done to protect both present and future generations from these tragedies.
It's happening too much.
Guys you realize banning guns won’t prevent tragic violence on campus.
Sorry to take away from the post honoring kendrick but this problem is bigger than just guns.
“Disarmed the STEM gunman.
” What’s a STEM gunman?
This is a brave kid who gave his life to save others in a school.
That statement should never have to be said again.
Truly a hero.
Thank you Kendrick.
God bless
It always amazes me that people like Kendrick exist.
I know full well if I was in a situation like this I would run and hide.
People who have this type of courage in these types of situations are special people.
Thank you.
"Being someone who goes to school in the area l, I'm honestly worried about a copycat shooter."
Thank you Kendrick Castillo.
It shouldn't have happened.
But unfortunately it did.
"But his decision to give up his life to save others required great courage, and it is the most selfless act any human can ever do."
He is a hero.
He died so that others wouldn't have to.
"Rest well, and thank you."
THANK YOU for not sharing the gunmans name.
To think he might have been one of the Boston Dynamics engineers if he was alive
"Please except my prayer: Dear God,Please let Kendrick Castillo plaza through your gates of heaven and live peacefully with you and others up there, Amen."
(If you are an Atheist just ignore this)
It’s not easy losing another Ironman
"On behalf of teenagers everywhere, thank you so much"
No one should ever have to lay down their lives for their friends in a place like a school.
This man is no less than a hero and should never be forgotten.
I am so glad that we’ve stopped focusing on perpetrators in the news and started honoring or remembering those who were unfortunate or brave enough to lose their lives in these events.
Rest in peace bro
A hero in my books.
He was a hero!
He saved others while sacrificing his safety and ultimately his life.
It is so unfair and depressing that an amazing young man like him no longer lives in this world but the piss ant who shot him does.
"RIP Kendrick, may we all be as strong and brave as you!"
"He is a true hero, God rest his soul"
People like this give me faith in humanity.
Thank you Kendrick.
You will be remembered.
"This young man should be getting 4x more airtime than the attackers, or any of our BS politicians."
"RIP Kendrick Castillo, a modern hero."
This literally happened 2 miles away from my school
> And a few others Well?
Who are they?
They are just as important!
"""No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends."
"""John 15:13"
"The word hero is used loosely nowadays, but this is a true hero"
Kendrick Castillo should never have had to be a hero.
He should’ve been a kid going home to his family that night.
STOP the madness and enact gun control laws now!
"A few tips:If you hear about a threat, get out of the school."
Treat it as if it *will* happen.
"If you are able to get the gun away from the shooter, threaten to shoot them if they move, and follow through if they do (in a non lethal spot)If you are in a shooting, if the gunman is reloading, that is your time for you and others to either attack or get away."
Hiding increases your chances of getting shot.
Your best bet is to run away.
effing heartbreaking.
i foresee a statue in his honor.
"People like to put down the current generation as entitled and lazy, but they aren’t."
True character and bravery shine through in critical moments like these.
True men will shine through when tested.
"Way to be a man, Kendrick."
"It's almost like we should protect schools like we do banks, politicians and celebrities."
Children are more important than all three.
I talk to one of the victim's friends on discord this fucking sucks.
So sick of these shootings it's infuriating that they still happen.
It so disheartening to hear the story and just it happening.
I wish there were some ways that all of this could have been prevented
I'm just asking why the US keeps letting things like this happening.
"I have a freind who goes to that school, he was not hurt, but did an interview on channel seven news."
He talked about how he saw this happen and how horrific it was.
I can't even imagine being in that situation.
"If Kendrick was your freind, or if you live in colorado or go to that school."
My condolences

I hate that this happened to this kid.
"Shouldn’t happen to anyone, anywhere."
But I’m so appreciative for his actions and his existence.
Didn’t deserve this.
Rip this hero.
I respect this man.
"In the story I read, his mother was frantically texting and calling him as he lay bleeding."
His classmates tried to hold close the wound and save his life.
This story makes me at once hopeful and full of despair.
"Kendrick, you are a better man at 18 than I could ever hope to be."
We lived in bad times already and it only got worse when Trump got elected.
No one can argue otherwise it’s a fact.
This young man is a hero in my book and may god help us all.
Rest in power Kendrick
Did the city officials just stop caring?

I admit I thought the water situation in Flint had already been taken care of due to the lack of news coverage and Reddit posts.
It's kinda hard to forget about when you live here.
"It's incredible that Pittsburgh, a much larger city, has almost the same lead levels and seems to have generated zero buzz or outcry about it."
wired.
So serious question.
what can we do about this?
Its my understanding that the piping for water is so fucked and it would cost so much that it would be cheaper to get up and move the entire town.
"Like honestly besides trucking in bottled water (which I really hope they do that at least), what can we do?"
I feel horrible for these people.
"Im not trolling I am looking for an actual response, anyone out there understand this enough to give me a break down?"
I really can't imagine what these people are going through.
Imagine working your whole life to buy a home to raise a family.
"Now, the water is tainted and the property value must be essentially zero."
Nobody is buying houses in Flint.
These people have no way out and every day the value of houses they have to keep paying for is going down and down.
"""It used to be cars were made in Flint, and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico."
"Now, the cars are made in Mexico, and you can’t drink the water in Flint!"
""" - POTUS"
I can't believe it's actually been almost 3 years!
300 union plumbers were in Flint this weekend installing waters filters that were purchased and donated.
Many families wouldn't be able to afford the filters on their own.
"Get your shit together, government."
Crazy that GallowBoob gets 88k karma and double gold for a reposted image of someone holding a sign.
A fucking sign.
"Idk, maybe, just maybe people should start focusing on their local governments and elected officials instead of the president."
If it wasnt posted by gallowboob it mightve meant something
Did we have elections this past year in Flint?
Has every elected official been voted out of office?
There is your answer.
In America you would think that doesn't exist.
Most third world countries go through that daily.
"Instead of ""don't forget"" posts to remind people, why not include why there is no water."
Whose fault is it that this hasn't been fixed yet?
"Obviously the city is still inhabited and functioning, but for some reason someone just hasn't green lighted the ""fix it"" operation."
Lets bring that person back into the light!
"That is surely more productive than ""it still sucks for people""."
Is it me or does it seem kind of sacrilegious that GallowBoob made this post clearly for the karma?
Are you gallowboob?
It's 2017.
GallowBoob has been posting everywhere since 2014.
hannity.
Then move the fuck out
"It's not just Flint, it's a lot of cities."
My small town has fecal matter on a regular basis where we have to boil and not drink the water.
We at the house only use it to shower and cook with.
Even then I don't feel healthy or clean.
Don't forget about this-----------------------------It's 2017GallowBoob has been a karma whore since 2014.
I can't believe that 3 years later people are still holding up signs in pictures on the internet.
Then move the fuck out
Then move the fuck out
"If a city in a first world country can't even provide clean water for its citizens after 3 years, they are no longer worthy to be a city in a first world country."
"Everything in the town should be dissolved, and the city/state should be providing the residents with fair compensation for their moving expenses."
"Put a nail in the coffin, and ensure that those who are responsible for this happening and not being fixed are held accountable for those actions."
"Money can't fix everything, and they have spent entirely to much trying to solve this problem without success."
But is this true?
It's 2017 and Flint still isn't the most affected American town with lead in their water.
Flint is just well known.
[removed]
Donald Trump has been in office for 3 days let's start blaming Trump
Is there any institution or group with a plan to fix it?
"""Barack Obama doesn't care about black people."
""" -- Kanye West :-)"
America is such a third world country sometimes it boggles my mind.
I mean are you guys even a nation?
How can you let this fly?
How are there no solidarity protests?
And don't tell me it's complicated.
It's not.
We solved clean water.
Its a matter of money that's it.
It's a shame for the United States just like what happened after Katrina.
But I guess poor people aren't really humans worth anything to the vast majority in the states.
It appears that privatizing everything means that water has been down-graded from a basic human right to something that not every human is entitled to
I would've moved by now
The problem is that completely rebuilding the infistructure of a city with no money takes a while
It's 2017 and I can still join a losing game in the last 10 seconds of modern FPS games.
Half of Obama's second term.
As if I can do fuckall about it
I don't know who Flint MI is but I assume he's a rapper with the worst name ever.
Just buy a bottle of water Flint MI maybe change you're name to LIL flint seems cooler.
I guess you should probably move then huh?
It's 2017.
The majority of Africa has been without clean water since the beginning of time.
Seems like most everyone has forgotten :/
Good thing we have u/GallowBoob to use this tragedy in order to gain as many fake internet points as possible.
Thank God.
When will reddit make it so I can block all of a user's posts and never have to see anything this fucking kid posts ever again

TIL people wore comically small ties back in the day
"It’s a portrait of my great great grandfather on the left, my dad also has the gap as well."
"It doesn’t always show , I guess bc my eyebrows are kinda unruly and curly so sometimes the gap is covered, I also sometimes fill them especially bc I’ve had people ask if I shaved the gap to be “cool” lol"
You two have similar noses too
"Whoa, that’s super cool!"
Genetics are so interesting.
Does your family have a hereditary monobrow nemesis family?
"If not, you should find one."
Somewhere in the dark ages: “Imma cut yer so hard yer kids’ll ‘ave scars!
"I don’t always filter reddit posts by “new,” but when I do eyebrows."
"Ohhhh at first I was looking at the gap BETWEEN your eyebrows, wondering what I was supposed to be seeing."
It took me way too long to notice the gap in the hair of each of your right eyebrows.
Bullshit that’s just you with short hair and a moustache.
Giant man or tiny tie?
Mine isn't hereditary.
Drunken stupidity.
It looks like his nose hung around too!
Very cool.
"Congratulations, too, on your excellent hair."
desert
Still waiting on the hereditary mustache eh?
It's so distinctive.
I think it gives you a great look.
I always thought those were scars.
Interesting.
Your Great Granddad looked like a young version of George Banks from Marry Poppins.
Maybe not hereditary but I love your hair!
Same but alcoholism.
And you know you would totally pull off a handsome moustache
"I have that too, but mine is a scar when I was 8 from spinning circles in our living room and walking back to my room, falling, and hitting my head on the banister corner."
The fact that you have a portrait of your great great grandfather is pretty fascinating in of itself
This man looks like Gilbert Fontaine De la Tour Dauterive
That's cool as hell!
Nice try future time traveller.
"At first I was like, ""Yeah, so does anyone without a unibrow"" but than I saw you meant a gap horizontally, rather than vertically."
Nice try you gender bending time traveller.
I like your hair.
You look pretty similar in general tbh.
It's kinda crazy seeing the genes passed through the generations.
"Similar eyes, nose, and lips."
The seed is strong
This is why Eyebrows Reddit.
Your great grandfather was a painting?
Damn you pull it off as well as your great grand pappy too
Good thing it's not a hereditary mustache 😛
There's a pretty notable amount of similarity in general which is pretty cool to see.
Vote for Pedro
Silently waiting for the commenters who mistake this for a r/RoastMe.

Very cool.
You found your next Halloween costume too!
"Wow, this is truly mildly interesting"
"Having a child with someone remotely similar to you is discount immortality, change my mind."
I just wanted to say that IMHO it was a good decision you got rid of the mustache.
Op should wear a fake moustache and a dark suit to mimic the painting.
You could be brow bros.
"Suspicious, do you usually hide it?"
There is nothing comical about your appearance.
BTW I love the curls.

Only good dreams from now on.

Do you use anything on your hair to combat frizz?
I'm a curly girl too and finding a product that actually works is a nightmare.
"Currently I'm using the ""no shampoo"" method and that's doing ok but I need a little extra treatment."
"Finding stuff in the stores is hard, it's either out of my budget or my store runs out or stops carrying it because small town and little selection."
I hear you on the curly eyebrow hair thing too.
It makes plucking them fun.
Eyebrow on fle
You’re beautiful!
I got a gap on my eyebrow too.
except I’m Asian.
Wuduuuup my sister from another mister!
But even cooler is that you also kinda look like Weird Al
Like father like son
The antimonobrow
That's awesome :)
Mildly interesting indeed!
Thank god you don't have a hereditary mustache gap as well!
I have hereditary eyebrows
Damn that’s cool
Just wait until the stache comes in.
"If your kids don’t have it, it may raise some eyebrows."
Sick!
"You'd look pretty dope with that mustache, too."
"Interesting, me and my dad's side of the fam have something like this, but ours is more vertical."
That's so cool!
Very interesting!
I knew a few kids with marks in their eyebrows growing up.
I always thought they were scars.
I have one as well but yours looks way cooler.
Mine is just a line and it's from putting my face through a windshield at about 45 mph.
That mildly interesting.
That’s pretty neat!
"Wonder what causes it (I mean, more specifically than just “genetics”)"
That tie.
The male side of your family must be very well endowed.
This is so cool!
Now im worried what weird trait of mine my great grandkids will get.
sorry future babies.
I have the same thing!
but it's because I got hit in the face with a pvc pipe as a kid.

"If you ever get super super wealthy, and like a bastard child enters your estate, your butler would call you and say something like ""HE HAS THE FAMILY MARK"""
"I have a thing that i don't think is hereditary, my eyebrows curl up in around the middle, kinda looking like horns (so i've been told)."
"Pretty sure i'm satan though, as i'm ginger too."
Still better then 1 eyebrow.
Now THAT'S interesting.
"Honestly you have the same face and eyebrow shape, it’s pretty impressive."
I was like .
I think everyone has that.
That's why they are called eyebrowS.
&#x200B;Then .
I think it's cooler that you have an old fucking painting of an ancestor.
DOPE.
Didn't inherit the mustache gap tho
not gonna lie - thats pretty cool you have an painting of your ancestor: Dave
This really is mildly interesting
Is like the birthmark of a Joestar!
I’m conflicted.
I want to upvote but this is just too damn interesting.
But can you rock a stache like that?
MIND THE GAP
A striking resemblance to Andrew Scott's version of Moriarty.
I suspect it maybe a cunning disguise to evade detection.
You are Moriarty in disguise.
Case closed Watson.
Doesn’t everyone have a gap between their two eyebrows?
You should be more concerned about that hereditary mustache when you hit your 40's.
"This is so mildly interesting, thank you for posting!"
Did Howard leave you any of the Stark fortune?
"But only in this one pic, apparently"
What’s your moustache look like?
I have a gap in my eyebrow too but I got mine when my older brother smashed me in the eye with one of those old timey calculators with the roll of paper coming out of the top.
How’s your mustache?
"All bs aside, I think that is freaking cool."
"Like, you could see someone and be like “wait, your eyebrow, could we be related?"
"” And, also for “how can we be sure she’s the true heir?"
” situations.
Own it.
Reminds me of the scar on the lip that Ezio passed down his line to Desmond
Mine look like that too but because I got kicked in the face.
this is seriously one of the most amazing demonstrations of genetics that I've ever seen.
so freaking cool.
thanks for sharing
This is awesome!
It suits you👍🏼.
"Looks dope, I like your hair too"
Beats having a vestigial monkey tail no?

Nuff said
"I believe that's called a ""mustache"" young lady."

What is that long scar around the midsection of the planet?
nasa.
nasa.
"The distance is 2500 kilometers from the surface of the  planet, with the scale being ."
6km/pixel.
The mosaic is composed of 102  Viking Orbiter images of Mars.
"The center of the scene (lat -8, long 78)  shows the entire Valles Marineris canyon system, over 2000 kilometers  long and up to 8 kilometers deep, extending form Noctis Labyrinthus, the  arcuate system of graben to the west, to the chaotic terrain to the  east."
Many huge ancient river channels begin from the chaotic terrain  from north-central canyons and run north.
"The three Tharsis volcanoes  (dark red spots), each about 25 kilometers high, are visible to the  west."
South of Valles Marineris is very ancient terrain covered by many  impact craters.
"Dang if you zoom in, you can see the individual craters, awesome picture"
Those 2.
Impact craters on the left are they fresh?
Is that why they're a darker brown color?
Edit: They're volcano's.
Thank you.
It reminds me a picture of earth without water.
Mars looks like our home.
"Based on this, we need an image of what Mars would look like with oceans and flora."
"And based on that, I bet we could create a general map of where the cities would have sprung up if they mirrored our development."

Gonna have to put an nsfw tag on it after Elon Musk finds this
I can’t wait until images of all of the other planets are this clear
What few are talking about is that this picture has seriously significant impacts on the future of colonization.
"Because whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars."
"So let's get to taking out their command, one by one."

"He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold."
What’s those 3 large dark brown spots on mars’ left side
I beg to differ .
There is a whole documentary about an astronaut being stranded on mars in hd quality

I immediately had to create a wallpaper out of this.
EDIT: Desktop wallpaper to clarify
I remember a while back when one of the first photos were taken on the surface and sent to Earth.
Everybody was surprised because it was so flat and barren and for some reason everyone was saying it sort of looked like Kansas.
"I wasn't expecting it, it was hard for me to picture the surface that way when you look at it from above, like this."
for some reason my brain always registers those images as renders.
i have to remind myself that this is not a 3D model but a composite of actual photographs of *another planet*.
Surreal
Why are the canyons on mars so different looking from canyons on earth?
Almost seeing the tiny houses owned by Area51 ailens.
"We get pictures of Mars, and first thing we do is roast it."
Any clue what the clearest image of mars is from photo technology on the earth?
I figure it might be a pleasingly striking comparison.

Is it me or does that look like a big battle scar across it?
"The two craters on the left side of the image, are those recent impacts (galacticly speaking)?"
It's weird to think our ancestors will be able to see Olympus Mons with their own eyes.
I wonder who the first person to summit THAT motherfucker will be.
You should all read Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy
What caused such a massive gash in the planet?
"It’s weird to think that Earth is probably just as marked up by meteorites but we don’t see the impacts in photos from space, with all the water and life and so on."
"The valles marineris is the coolest shit ever, grand canyon looks like a tiny crack in comparison."
"The (what I think are) craters on the left, odd that they're in an almost perfect line"
"That’s a graze wound, possibly from the claws of an intergalactic phoenix."
dosen't look clearer than the last time this was posted.
Can’t wait for the unrelenting reposts “taken from my backyard with my iPhone 11.

I don’t get why earth only has a dozen craters visible from space but every other terrestrial object in space has thousands.
Can someone pinpoint where curiousity rover is now currently in this image?
wow that’s the clearest image of mars ever taken.
Why does Mars look like it’s making the 😑 face?
The fuck?
Why doesn’t dust or birds or asteroids or glare or SOMETHING make this picture blurry?
This is incredible
Why don't they aim that MUTHERFUKER at the moon and see if there is a go cart and shit to show if people were really there.
Then what about the clearest image of Earth ever taken?
Now if only we could get a clear image like this of Olympus Mons.
It amazes me that we get so much coverage on a 3 lens iPhone yet I hear almost nothing about the amazing engineering that it takes to produce an image like this.
Am i the only one that sees a '•____•' face on mars?

For the first time since I was a kid I just thought about a favorite planet.
"If they terraform Mars and colonize it, kids will look at Mars like I looked at NYC."
Some grand place I could move to when I turn 18.
Except now we are talking other planets.
I know it’s just a picture but seeing it this clearly makes it seem so much closer in every way.
The day we colonize Saturn is going to be a shit show.
Does anyone know what is speculated to have created that giant scar?
Whether we wanted it or not.
we’ve taken a clear picture of the surface on Mars
I want anal beads that are accurate to scale (comparatively) of the nine planets.

Looks like it’s frowning at Earth as it knows we are destined for the same fate.

As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body.
I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.
3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival.

"#EDIT 40,000 POINTS AT ALMOST EXACTLY 30 MINUTES PUTS THIS AT *NUMBER 3 ALL TIME TOP POST*Edit: 45,491 points 30 minutes later."

Edit: The number is probably decreasing due to reddit's vote fuzzing and the algorithm that allows pages to 'decay' off the front page after a while.
Come back tomorrow for the final tally.
______Edit one week later: Down to 5000 and change.
I don't know what happened but it looks pretty fucky to me.
___**One year edit!
"** Reddit ""allowed"" all points to show a while back, so now we can see its true total sits at roughly 141,500."
The number is still fuzzed so I can't say the exact number.
As of 07/27/17 it is the number 9 top post of all time across all of reddit.
"So this hit 40k in under an hour, now it's down to a relatively mediocre (for the front page) 4."
The algorithm is fucking retarded.
Why did this go down to 5000 upvotes?
"It was around 50,000 last night"
What happened to all the upvotes?
"After about 30 minutes it had about 43,000 upvotes, then it decreased to about 4,000"
This might be THE fastest upvoted post in Reddit history.

There can't be that many downvotes on this?
"Why has this dropped from nearly 20,000 upvotes to almost 7,000 in just a couple of hours?"
Are you all fucking morons?
How could it have been downvoted 30K times and still have 97% upvotes.
Reddit's algorithm to keep posts from staying at the top forever is what causes this
"I can't believe that this post went from 42,000 upvotes down to led then 7,000."
What the fuck is that all about?
This post was at 40k last night and now only 6k?
To answer the question being asked over and over.
Reddit has a soft capping system that kicks in for highly voted submissions.
It helps normalize them to other submissions.
"Contrary to popular belief the number displayed is not upvotes, but rather points."
Upvotes are only one component of points.
"I believe points may return to normal after some period of time, but I am not sure of the current status of that."
It was being discussed at one point.

That day was not full of holiday cheer.
It got even better when the vet said the dog would have to pass them and he couldn't do surgery.
"Long story short, the dog screamed for two days and sprayed diarrhea every time I walked her to move things along."
Fun times!
Is no one else here gonna address the fact that GBBO is playing in the background?
Me every time someone brings cookies to the office.
"No, no."
I’m watching my weight.
So dramatic
"Congrats, you made me ugly laugh at work"
"Mine will think I'm not looking ,then slowly pull a piece of food off my plate,and haul ass."
"He stole a hot dog out of the bun once, before I noticed"
"OMG, this plays out in my house EVERY SINGLE DAY!"
What I look like when friends are eating korean bbq and I'm eating a vegetarian dish 😆
My ex when I actually ordered fries after asking her if she wanted some.
ROFL I swear he was going to back flip off the couch if you looked one more time.
Intimidated by this guy's snack game.
"Just shove your dirty arm in a chip bag like the rest of us, you fancy bitch."
Is that Keanu from the future?
Dude.
your breath is so bad!
"""I did the head turn away thingy, now where is my treat!"
Your girl when she says she isnt hungry
This is hilarious.
"But it's not that he's ""pretending"" not to care."
It's pack behaviour.
"The dog sees the man as the alpha, and the alphas eat first."
The dog doesn't want the alpha human to think he's challenging him for the food.
When the dog turns his head it's a sign of submission.
It's more an instinctive fear actually.
What’s he eating there?
Carrots and hummus?
A fine meal for a man and dog.
I like how he looks up higher and higher each time
Damn Bob have you seen how nice the weather is today?
Reminds of me of when I eat with my wife.
For sure after her soup or whatever small thing is gone and I am enjoying the bread or steak I have.
I love how on each look away he gets more and more dramatic with it.
"My dog knows he isn't supposed to beg, and this is his workaround."
Apparently it isn't begging if we don't make eye contact.
I was wondering what David Guetta was up to these days.
You can't see him unless you're looking directly at him 😁Dogs are the best
The whole thing is enchanted just knowing he’s watching Great British Bake-off in the background 😂
I'm more invested in figuring out which episode of the great british bake off is on in the background
"I used to have a dog almost identical to that one, she was called sandy (original) and she used to do that too, she also used to break out and roll in fox shit on a bi-daily basis, loved her but she's was a pain."
Shame you miss them pains when they've gone
what is the instinctual explanation of this ?
"This dude look/behavior reminds me of those ultra high functioning daily pot smokers, probably surfs and owns a tech company"
"my boxer used to do this, passed away a few months ago"
This is gold 🥇!
Me to girlfriend: do you want anything?
- No*me orders food**me eats food*My girlfriend :
"Wow, david guetta looks so old now"
When my girlfriend noticed me looking at boobs.
My old dog was the complete opposite.
She’d stare at the food and when I looked at her she’d look right at me trying to look cute and guilt trip me into giving her a bite.
I miss her so much.
That dog is every teen guy sneaking a peek at tits.
THE KING BEYOND THE WALL
"Having taken care of multiple dogs at once, this is behavior they do with each other, if someone's bothering another dog while theyre eating, and the eating dog looks directly at the other dog, hes going to start growling and possibly bite unless the other dog stops and shows some obvious signs of submission (turning their head to look in the other direction)."
"“Oh look,  a ceiling”"
"As a dog owner and trainer, this reaction is typical when a dog was too noisy and the owner told him off / punished him."
The next level beg
I like how each time he turns his head even further away.
"Lmao, great post!"
Jeremy Irons's hippy little brother seems pretty chill.
I think the dog is more interested in the Great British bake off on the telly
A cat would have just knocked the tray over.
I love how every time his head away intensifies.
"""Babe, you want a side of french fries?"
"""""No, I'm not that hungry."
He dont want no smoke
Dude is eating carrot sticks while watching the Great British Bake Off.
That’s some torture right there.
Does the man not get it?
HE IS NOT INTERESTED!
When you staring at a girl and she catches your eye
Why would a dog pretend to be uninterested?
Man needs bigger couch.
Dude this is why I want a dog lol
Can someone who is a dog psychologist explain why dogs do this
"From the thumbnail, I thought your dog was a penis."
That's a good boye.
He deserbes treet
Dude looks like Adrian Brody
Give him some
Christ !
Give him something already!
Why do all Labs do this?
LMFAO that's jokes!
My dog walks away whenever I eat.
Cuz he knows he ain't getting nun of dis hooman food.
Lookin at my crush
But it’s veggies!
Doggo wants veggies?
Id knock that off my lap withing the first 10 minutes
Thanks for that.
How did he not laugh when looking at his dog?
Alpha dog
That's a funny doggo
"Man, do I love dogs."
Dude looks like 70 year old keanu reeves
Me after I told my boyfriend I didn’t want anything
"Mine does the same, it’s so adorable"
The comical timing deserve a doggie Oscar.
David Guetta?
Just waiting for some self proclaimed dog expert to tell us this guy is beating his dog or some dumb shit.
This is awesome!
I imagine that's how men look like when sneak looking at women's breasts.
Why do dogs do this?
I've seen it so many times.
Dogs really are like toddlers!
When you hungry but aloof as hell
Reminds me of a creep  at work who stares At chicks
I'm glad John finally got a few more dogs in his retirement age.
Hahaha my dog does the same thing and we haven't even taught her not to beg for food.
Many dogs just know instinctively that they're not supposed to lust for food belonging to someone else.
"I can see her in the corner of my eye looking longingly when I'm making sandwiches, then when I look her way she will immediately look away and pretend to look at something else, until I look back at the sandwiches."
":D It's so cute, haha!"
Me sitting in the theatre next to a stranger.
"I'm sitting here on the crapper and seeing this man with all his snacks and dip on a pillow on his lap and like ""damn this man is living his best life"""
B-Baka!
I didn’t want the food anyways!
Deception is not a skill that good boys practice.
I’m that sneaky black dog that barely got into the frame
My little dog does this too and it cracks me up 😂
"""The trick is to act like you don't want it."
My dog would saber tooth tiger my neck to get some of that food.
Looking away is a rookie move to him.
When we feed our 6 year old we say “protect your food from the dog.
Its impressive how he knows the second the human looks away too
"""I really am not looking."
I swear.
Please don't insult me.
I don't care if you give me anything.
I don't even like this food that much.
I'm sitting here blank-faced at my shit job.
Nice little few seconds before I go back to blank face.
This man looks exhausted.
That is basically me around pretty girls
THIS IS MY NORMAL CASUAL POSTURE.
They’re watching my favorite episode!
Nice dog
Good choice of show!
Luke Wilson's dog is in the biz too I see.
Omg that is so cute!
Thanks for reminding me that there’s a new episode of Great British Baking Show!
this is what it looked like when the first dog and human were partnering up
That’s what my dog does as well but to only my dad
my girlfriend watching me eat my food that looks better than what she ordered
"Honestly though, can anyone explain why they do that?"
"I mean, it's cute as fuck and amazing but I'd love to know what's going through their little cute fluffy heads."
My dog kind of does this too when I am holding a treat.
She would look other way while being clearly interested in a treat.
Is it common among dogs?
"I reaaaaally hope the dog just actually does this, and it's not a trained thing."
"If it is a trained response, don't tell me!"
I want to think the dog is just hilarious.
"Whatchu want, girl?"
"""Nothin""."
"I'll get you some fries ""Nah"" (\*I order one large fry with burger, she eats half the fries."
Great British Bake Off 👍
My dog does this too and it's hilarious.
My dog absolutely loves baby carrots.
Their his favorite thing ever.
I could watch this tv show all day.
He's fucking adorable.
"You fool, you absolute buffoon!"
"I have been staring at the food the whole time, you have been tricked by the trickster himself!"
My dog would just start eating my food if he got that close to my plate.
Me when the girl I like looks at me
Hahaha I love the Great British Bake Off in the background
me looking at my crush irl.
When you’re on a diet.
omg so cute x’D
I just realised a new episode of The Great British Baking show came out last night

Biscuits week on TGBBS - sweet.
Great British baking show!
Love it!
this is so heart warming
wow what a great friend to have!
so jealous
Don’t be suspicious.
Don’t be suspicious.
I had my dog trained like this but when I'd look at him he'd leave the room.
Thats awesome hahaha!
My moms long haired chihuahua does this.
lol I bet that good boy got a snack when the cam was off.
Why do dogs do this?
Not gonna lie that couch looks uncomfortable as fuck.
That’s so very funny
dog's got good peripheral vision
Me every time I see a hot girl.
This video has two major pluses.
1) dog.
no more must be said2) Great British Baking Show in the background
"The dog is like me, when people look at me in the eyes, I look away as quickly as possible to avoid eye contact."
it weird to look at the person directly in the eyes when you’re not talking to them
Staged.
That dog’s a good actor though.
Too funny for words.
I *hear* that dog planning his move X'D
My dog does this when I try to take a pic of him.
not beggin'.
just don't want ya to forget about me.
"y'know, in case you end up with too much food or anythin'."
This is when you ask your girlfriend if she is hungry and she says no but secretly wants your fries
Just too proud
"Man, animals are so damn cool."
too relatable
"Dog be like - ""Look at the ceiling, man!"
It's cracking up ther.
The fact that he’s watching The Great British Baking Show just makes this video so much better
So adorable
you can tell a lot about a person by how they interact with their dog
Thanks for this!
His breath stank
He just wants a taste to make sure it’s not poisonous for his human.
Me and my pups every night.
The GBBS was the cherry on the icing.
Can we talk about how that looks like the most uncomfortable couch ever.
Pack behaviors are so interesting and silly.
My dog does that
I just want to watch you eat
"My dog is just the opposite, she can't take off her eyes from the food."
But this is absolutely hilarious.
My dog hates vegetables
Sounds like you are.
Too cute ❤
This is literally the dad and dog posts
At least doggo doesn't stay starring when he looks at him and making him feel like a dbag for not sharing
"Just give him a treat, you monster!"
That is me when someone next to me enters a password
My dog does this too.
"Sometimes I mess with her and l  kinda snarl like a wolf does when you get to close to the food, and she Tries to lick my face in submission"
I love how he times it so perfectly
I like her attitude.
It's a trick.
"""Hey look fly on the wall"""
When your girl tells you she’s not hungry
JUST GIVE HIM SNACK YOU MONSTER!
"Somehow they both look like dogs, it’s amazing!"
Now that's way too cute.
It’s not like i want any of that food or anything.
BAKA - Tsundere Dog
"""Oh my, we oughta do something about these popcorn ceilings is what I'm looking at."
That's a fine ceiling we have.

Give him some of those carrots.
Jesus Christ I swear dogs got human souls in em
And that's reason I downloaded reddit!
This has to be the sweetest thing
I can't wait until my dog is this good.
He's a 6 month old beagle right now though
I think it would be difficult to be a dog
"And the Oscar for ""Least Interested in Food"" goes to."
Cat like
That made me laugh!
Great video
Ha ha ha.
LolIt's made my day!
"hahahahha, this is what internet is made for XD"
"We don't deserve dogs, they're just so adorable"
This is the cutest thing!
Told you I am not at all interested in your nasty ass food.
When you don’t offer your gf some food
Haha love it
WHat A GOOD LITTLE FURBABY SO CUTEEEE!
That dog is like my girlfriend
"Amazing, my dog used to do that when he was younger, now he just stares right back at me like ""yeah i want some of your food""."
I think he was trying to convince himself instead of the man.
My dog did this too.
"The caption fits perfectly, made me smile *hehehe*"
Crying laughing!
I love this so much thanks for sharing ❤️
Really digging that he’s watching The Great British Baking Show
its so dramatic and adorable!
My dad's dog does this.
If you look at her with the corner of your eye she's doing major side-eye at the food too.
"That's a dog that was taught not to beg, seen many like this mine included"
I hate it when dogs loiter around food.
Can anyone explain why the dog is doing this.
What does the dog believe is happening at that moment?
I am watching the great British bake off while looking at this video
Labs.
Always with the labs.
They crack me up.
"For such an intelligent breed, they ain’t half stupid."

When your girl says she doesn't want food.
after argument :mom :- come and eat someme :- i am not hungry (\*also me\*)
You sure that is not a cat in a dogs body?
My cats used to pull similar shit.
I want to be petted.
WHY ARE YOU PETTING ME?
GO AWAY.
I want to be petted!
I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE.
why are you leaving?
PET ME!
"Dogs are so awesome, man."
"I mean, why would he feel the need to hide that he's interested in the food?"
That's something that would guess its pretty rare for a dog to do.
Not sure how he learnt that!
Anyone know what breed that good boy is?
my gf when she said she didnt want anything in the drive through
Daddy must be used to this.
How could he not crack up every time?
GIVE HIM A PIECE

From what I’ve heard dog are very protective of the food that they are eating at the moment.
"Since the owner is the alpha of the pack, the dog is not showing any interest in the food out of obedience and/or respect."
This is my gf when she says she doesn’t want anything at the drive thru.

Best idea ever !
I hope they will work on the roads now.
As the old saying goes he’s a “geographer in the sheets but an astronaut on the streets.
See moon landing was fake.

How do you protest for better roads?
You planet.
"Ah, good ol’ Bangalore."
Now i can’t stop thinking about Neil Armstrong moving his first steps on the moon and having to dodge a Rickshaw in the process.
"Say what you want, that was cinematic as fuck!"
I'm an Indian and even I couldn't recognise that's a road until the camera changed the angle.
Damn that was a great work by the camera guy and a great idea by the guy on screen too
The creativity from this guy is out of this world !

Holy shit this made me audibly laugh.

Kubrick filmed the moon landing in India and not a bloody sound stage.

"Its in Bangalore, Karnataka."

Still works.
That's a better space suit than anything I could throw together
"Relevant clever joke, as yesterday only India carried out a flawless operation to separate the lunar landing module."
Now that's a whole new level of creativity

I thought I heard recently that the Indian government was worried about the upcoming generation and finding work for them.
"Well shit, what better way to give these people a source of income and hope than to put them to work building their Infrastructure?"

That those were Michigan roads for a minute.
Looks like Indianapolis!
One small step for naan
/u/vredditdownloader
Some of the best trolling I've seen in along time.
*laughs in Michigan*
"I knew it is a bad road because roads in my country are the same as in the video, (if you live in a 1st."
world country you should be grateful).
Shame the stupid fucking title spoiled the punchline.
"They had us in the first half, not gonna lie"
India is weird.
"At one side modern infrastructure and on the other vast amounts of trash, inequality, and shitty infrastructure"
"ngl, the title kinda spoiled the clip."
"That being said, it was a damn good clip."
He should try to visit Belgium then.
Could be New Jersey.
They fix the road and there’s a crew behind them tearing it up.
I thought this was the real moon landing
"As an Indian, I felt those bumpy rides at the back of the auto rickshaw."
Are you sure this isn't Michigan?
I never knew India was located on the moon
"This footage is faked, it was clearly shot on the moon."
I mean.
Had me fooled for a good sec.
Is Indian roads really that bad?
Wtf does the gov do?
Indian astronaut on the moon circa 2019
I don't know shit about India but everytime I see it represented in media it's looks like the entire country is just impoverished and riddled with crumbling infrastructure.
Yet it also seems like they have massive potential.
I really want to learn more about India I suppose.
"Hell, I don't even know what type of government they have."
I apologise if I'm way off base here.
"Where we are going, we don't need roads"
Brilliant!
Ingenious!
Are you sure that's not Michigan?
India as a country is quite wealthy but the politicians are very corrupt and find any excuse to not spend public funds so they can be spent on themselves.
At least that's what our guide for Old Delhi told us.
If the government distributed it's wealth fairly you would see Indian standards rise significantly faster then they currently are.
I’d vote for this guy.
The moon landings were faked in Michigan
That's pretty darn funny.
I think this guy has a future in marketing.
"Genius, he could be protesting the poor air quality too!"
I bet you if he grabbed 10 buddies with shovels then they could fix it all and bust it out in less than a day
We need a Bollywood moon landing video conspiracy.
The irony is that India sent a probe to the moon this year.
Having visited Mumbai several times this is not rare.

that's pretty good
goodness them potholes seemed like it could even make a soviet tank driver cry
Is this where the India's moon landing supposed to take place :-/
for seconds thought he is on moon
Those roads are even worse than California's.
Damn.
What a lunatic.
In some countries they drive on the left hand side of the road.
In some countries they drive on the right hand side of the road.
In India they drive on whatever is still a road.
This is funny as hell
Fantastic
That is an excellent protest.
this guy rules!
Yeah well when elephants and oxen with carriages share the roads too it's gonna be messed up.
I dont suggest it but if you paint racist symbols on the road they would probably be pretty quick to fix it
Is he on the moon?
"Goddam, first I thought it was satire and that it was an actual video from the moon."
Not gonna lie they had me in the first half.
It would have been funnier if the title didn't give it away.

This is an insult to Feregis.
This is an insult to the Ferengi
That's an insult to the Ferengi.
Though I bet he still abides by their Rules of Acquisition.
Ima support China just to piss off redditors
Haha China bad America good now give me karma 😤😤
China bad upvote
It's funny how much you guys think Xi or the CCP care about this.
"Please, don’t stop, continue to link to American Movies, TV, Games, Products, Companies."
"It’s not just Blizzard, or Apple, or the NBA, they are just the ones that got caught."
"Me: \*Download's a copy to repost as a banned image in China for the sweet, sweet, karma in a few days."
Oh wow another karma whore doing nothing but post images in r/pics
I said perfection and you delivered.
Maybe he should try drinking some root beer.
For now.
Daaaang those earbrows are nuts!
It sucks to be this guy .
"Chinese communist party will now ban the show where the main characters work for a regime that doesnt use money (or just some vaguley defined ""credit), one of its bad guys are a bunch of super-capitalists and one of the main character slammed the shit outta some 21st century american banker for his fixation with money and personal wealth."
looks like a stand
Hes ugly even for this kind of alien
"Yeah, let Disney's Star Wars burn."

Those are some pretty big ears for someone who doesn't care to listen.
this picture isn't banned in China.
FINALLY XI IS SEXUALLY APPEALING!
*Xi Jinping would like to know your location.

This genuinely made me cackle when I opened up Reddit.
Was not prepared
"Nah, man."
Even the Ferengi wouldn't want Xi.
That's just insulting.
Virtually everything is banned there.
#FreeFerenginar
"Fuckin Ferengi, man."
Isn't banned YET in China
Nor should it be ; )
Isnt banned in China.
He does look an awful lot like nog
Ferengi-Xi
Hold my honey
"I doubt they take little things like ""is it actually banned or not"" into account in China these days."
Watch the Reddit shills take this down after they're done sucking Xi's cock
He definitely knows all the rules of accusation by heart
Why is this on r/pics
"they really are using outdated despotism, IMO."
It would have been best just to ignore the stupid stuff that cant actually hurt the state.
"yeah yeah yeah, youd like to have a north korea style cult but all you can do is bring attention to it and make it even more powerful than if you had just ignored it."
the only reason why reddit even bothers to post the poo meme is because china doesnt want them to.
Its the steisand effect.
"sorry china, but you got to update your despotism manual for the modern age."
"Ignore the memes, not ignoring them only makes them more powerful."
"Hell of a barterer, those guys."
Hahahahahahahaha
Xi is a piece of trash
Inconceivable
And it's far more appropriate than Winni Xi Pooh

What an insult to the Farengi.

I hate mornings.
I don't like waking up.
I don't like breakfast as a genre or activity.
I don't see a good reason to be anywhere ever before 10am.
I started forcing myself to wake up early and go to the gym before work.
And i hate it so much but it makes me feel so goddam good all day long.
"It's a shitty healthy dose of morning endorphins that stops me from getting sleepy after lunch, keeps me energized after work, get a better night's sleep."
It sucks so much and it sucks even more that it improves every aspect of my day because now if i stop i know i'll just start having shitty bad days again and it'll be my dumbass lazy fault with a simple fix.
That guy wants to settle for anything out of fear of nothing better coming later.
"That guy is okay with the dead-end job, the abusive relationships and no master's degree."
"I tell that guy it's never gotten me anywhere, it's the definition of ""stuck"" and I have no intention of being stuck anymore."
That guy's kicking my ass right now.
"It used to be eat cheap pizza, chain smoke, and play video games."
I changed a lot of those habits to healthier ones.
"That guy’s cousin lives in my head, I go to AA meetings to avoid and outwit him."
The guy who wants to go streaking during the Super Bowl halftime show.
I avoid him by remembering that prison is not a pleasant place to be.
"I used to have a little sign on my desk that said ""The worst possible feeling is when the person you are meets the person you could have been."
"""  It was there to encourage to pursue my goals rather than procrastinate on games, Reddit, etc."
I think it's time I dug that sign out again.
Bold of you to assume I avoid him.
All that guy wants to do is do Reddit and play videogames.
I don't do anything to avoid him.
We came to an agreement and take turns occupying the same body.
It's me from 5:30 am  to 5pm on weekdays.
"And he gets evenings,  weekends and holidays."
I have the same exact same guy in my head.
"I quit smoking pot years ago, before i hit 30."
I can still stay in bed all day on some days.
"What keeps me from doing it (having a 24h lay in on my laptop) too often are commitments I've made to myself, friends, and employers."
Back in the day pot made it really easy to give up on those commitments.
"I miss pot, but I don't miss those times in general, which keeps me from going back."
That guy is my ADHD.
"I probably have an extreme case where my meds, which are at high doses, hardly even work anymore."
"The best way I combat this urge to do something fun, play games, or goof off is to remove myself from any place of temptation."
Cut it off before you get the thought of even doing something pleasurable.
What I do is that I find empty classrooms at my college and study or do work in there.
"I will purposively drive away from my home (which is full of games, food, fun, and comfort) to a classroom just so I don’t get the urge, and even if I do, I’ve created a barrier that takes too much guilt and effort of driving back and doing something fun"
"I have chronic severe depression, going 25 years now."
"It's not completely clear what I have but it comes and goes (not SAD, not bipolar, not mdd, we simply don't know and medication doesn't work)."
"However, it's never really gone, it's more like manageable or unmanageable."
"The voice is either telling me I should lie down and just give up, or it's telling me that soon I will be lying down and giving up again."
"My manageable moments are obviously filled with as much joy as I can pack in there, and every night before going to bed I tell the voice to suck it, today was my day, not yours."
"When it's unmanageable and the voice tells me to give up I try to fight him as long as I can, and when I start to agree with him I always manage to end it with ""but not today""."
"It's kept me alive for this long, I hope I can keep going like this for awhile."
"Might get buried, but my dude in my head is literally Mr."
"Spock from Star Trek, and I don't avoid him."
Hear me out - I discovered through therapy that I needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and Mr.
Spock is that dude.
He can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively.
"Spock: ""The massive space blob has a 97."
454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes.
Projections show it will be slow and painful.
"""Kirk: ""That's horrible!"
"""Spock: ""Yes, it is not ideal for our continued survival, but it's actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob."
"""So, whenever I get spun up on something in my head I imagine a mini-Spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about ME."
"me: ""Spock, science report."
"""Spock: ""Data shows that godspeedmetal is 5."
8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake.
"He isn't consciously aware of it, but he's attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes."
"""me: ""Thank you, Spock, sounds like I'm being dishonest with myself."
I suck!
"""Spock: ""I disagree."
It's entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake.
This is neither Good or Bad.
Just natural.
Data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89.
You've yet to procure a nicotine source as well.
Commendable.
"""Just going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state, help sort out emotions, feelings, all that stuff, into a parsed, objective, and most importantly, non-judgemental way."
"EDIT: holy shit, I'm happy this was received as well as it was."
"This mechanism has helped myself so much, however I'd offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don't have your expectations set correctly."
"One - Spock's reports WILL be amended, appended, referenced and reworked entirely."
This is all part of the process.
Even Spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou.
Don't treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal.
Your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future.
"Two - You WILL fail, as well, and that's totally OK!"
"He's analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety, struggles with work, and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal."
"But sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that ""getting gas"" was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn't come from a single analysis, but was referenced from a prior ""science report"", as at one point I had quit smoking, went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket."
"Spock reported, ""godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine."
Further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal's psyche at a subconscious level.
The strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong.
*Fascinating.
"*"" Spock doesn't judge me - it all is what it is - and I respond, ""That IS fascinating!"
My mind is stranger than I ever thought possible.
"However, I am more in control because I now recognize this pattern of behavior."
I believe that this can be identified at a later point if I do this again.
"Thank you, Spock."
""" That failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself."
And FYI - I'm several months smoke free and still going!
"Three - this isn't to make someone an emotionless logic machine, either - Spock understands human nature is an emotional experience."
"Humans get horny, sad, happy, angry, depressed, excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it's all part of the Logic of Being Human."
"Take that into account, yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally."
Four - trust your intuition.
Your instincts have been developed over millions of years of evolution.
Your mind is *powerful* and can sub-consciously recognize threats and boons to your world and yourself.
"Even if you don't understand *why* your guts are reacting they way they are, don't dismiss it."
"Run it by Spock and if you don't come to a satisfactory answer, you can always revisit later when you've more experience, time, and data."
"The guy in my head wants to lay in my pillow-top bed with soft, soft sheets, my buffy blanket, memory foam pillows, and sleep 18 hours a day (and hide from everyone)."
"Punctuated by gorging myself on (good) takeout food, getting raving drunk, and just watch endless history documentaries and plan travel trips for next year."
"If that's all I did I would also probably take up smoking pot again, too."
"He just wants to win the lottery and sit on his couch watching dark comedies, drinking until it kills him."
"I avoid this by remembering that my mother would be very sad if that happened, and that I want to love someone, like really be in love, at least one more time before I go."
"I accept that she exists, and love her back to health"
I relate to this.
"The girl in my head is constantly trying to get out of doing things - every ""thing"" like going to work, going to school, socializing, etc."
I have to force myself everyday to do all the stuff that being an adult human requires of me.
It's hard.
I think almost everyone feels this way.
That girl is depression.
She's definitely starting to kick my ass now.
"All she wants to do is lay in bed, self-harm, and cry."
"I take my medications and persevere, but it's difficult."
"I let her out and feed her once in a while, that way she lets me get on with my life!"
youtube.
The guy in my head not letting me lay in bed all day smoking pot and watching cartoons.
*closes pornhub* I dunno what you're talkin' bout.
That guy wants to die.
Unsure how to avoid him.
Copious amounts of caffeine seems to do okay.
"That guy for me is someone who is constantly grumpy, never wants to get out of pajamas, and loves being drunk and high."
"To avoid said guy, I make a conscious effort to stay productive, motivate myself, and never drink alone."
I figure that I may as well share about my guy.
"My guy hates me, and what little bit of a life I've built for myself."
"The guy in me just wants to lay in bed all day, every single day, until I age out and die."
Don't even get me started on the *other thing* the guy wants to do to me.
"And, yeah, it's pretty similar to Bourdain's in terms of its other cravings."
"To fight back, I try listening to music that fits my emotions at the moment."
"I try keeping my hands busy, and luckily I enjoy cooking."
Deck building for magic the gathering can also help.
I try to be creative and draw more.
I try to exercise.
I go out and tell jokes at open mics.
I try to do everything that my guy doesn't want me to do.
I want to be better than the guy that my guy wants me to be.
"He does have a grip on me most days, but I try my hardest to get out of it."
Holy shit Anthony said that?
Damn.
I miss him even more.
I just wanna grill for gods sake
He’s the voice that tells me to stop what I’m doing and end it all.
To avoid him I just ignore what he says.
At the moment he’s wrong.
"Have to say, I am touched by OP’s attentiveness to responses displaying distress."
Wholesome.
"Ah, RuPaul caller her the “inner saboteur”."
It sounds cliché but it’s so true.
"And “that guy” never really goes away, you just have to learn to stay one step ahead."
Why try to outwit and avoid that guy?
My goal in life is to find a way to sustain the lifestyle that guy suggests.
"The only reason I even do any of that other ""ambitious"" stuff is so that I can do all the nothing I want."
That guy is me.
Tried doing push-ups.
gave all the motivation I needed to get off my ass cause I was so pathetic
"The one that wants to to something drastic to qualify for Social Security disability and then, jobless, lounge around all day drinking beer, watching whatever, and roaming around GTA 5 as I eat the gubment cheese."
[deleted]
My guy wants to smoke weed and play guitar all day.
It just happens to be my job and I'm trying to turn it into an originals career now with a new band.
I got tired of fighting him so I just embraced the fucker.
"I’m a microbiology major, premed and all but sometimes I really just want to stay at home and be a cute little housewife."
I want to have three kids and be a pta mom!
I love the idea but I know I couldn’t be truly happy with that.
My guy just wants to sleep.
All fucking day.
oh  i am suppose to AVOID him?
The guy doesn't believe I'll ever be happy.
He thinks I'll ruin every relationship I'm in and give up on every endeavor I do.
My hobbies and family help me out.
Mine tells me to end it and that even all the hurt that comes with it that it's better to leave everyone and everything and start over.
He just wants to start over.
Started selling all my stuff to appease him.
Me right now.
I finally admitted this week I am depressed.
Now I have to do something about.
Poor Anthony Bourdain.
Rest In Peace
[deleted]
I don’t avoid him.
"I hate all this climb the ladder, work constantly, ‘self-improvement’ shit."
It’s just about making you feel bad about yourself in the hopes you will buy some shit you don’t need.
As far as I can tell all it does is make people desperately unhappy.
They become perfectionists and they are never good enough for themselves.
"I work hard, I live a quiet life, and you can bet your arse I will spend my free time relaxing and engaging in personally enjoyable activities."
"I don’t owe this world my ‘best self’, because I’m fine as I am."
I certainly don’t need to buy any ‘motivational material’ or other cliched shite to make myself feel better.
"I don’t need a program, I don’t need to pay a man to show me how to do incredibly basic gym moves, and I don’t need any fucking entrepreneurial seminars."
Basically fuck off and let me spend my goddamn Sunday’s getting high and enjoying what little time I have on this Earth.
That guy for me is the same as his.
My guy doesn't want to bother being alive.
"I avoid him by positive thinking, recognizing mental distortions, therapy, and increasingly exercise."
Same guy.
He wins most days but I’m trying.
So the guy (gal) in my head is kind of a depression riddled monster.
"She tells me I'm worthless, useless, will never amount to anything."
I go to therapy once a week to learn ways to outsmart her and prove her wrong.
I don't think it will ever stop but I'm learning ways to cope.
Sonofabitch gets nothing.
All he wants to do is drink his life away.
"Hes already had 10 years of my life, he doesnt get a second more!"
Same thing as tony described.
I used to tak lots of Adderall to chain that mofo down.
He's what I call the devil but really he's just depression and anxiety due to BS like existentialism.
Anyways.
"Treat yourself well, even the demons."
They're part of you too.
True healing doesn't come from pills.
I found that out the hard way.
"Ive been recently dealing with a pretty tough breakup, one that i caused due to me not being mentally well."
I decided to start going to Therapy once a week and Ive been pushing myself out of bed every single morning to go for a 30 min run before work and after work i hit them gym.
Im just trying to be a better person for myself and actually be happy with my life for once.
I know things dont come over night but with progress ill reach my goal eventually.
giphy.
"If I have the will, multiple strategies work including, eating properly, exercising, meditation, talking to friends, talking to family, keeping clear priorities of what I want to do."
unfortunately every now and then something trips everything up and the will to out maneuver the 'guy in my head' isn't there.
That guy is all the more persuasive when you feel like a (to quote Kyle Kinane) “stripped-bare toothless cog spinning freely and ineffectually in the working machine of society”.
I joined the Army.
Now that guy doesn't have much of a choice.
That girl does a lot of partying and is a free bird flying but this woman's kids keep her grounded and at home.
I dunno.
that guy sounds ok to me.
I'd hang out with him.
Cartoons are awesome.
"The guy in my head just wants to eat junk food, play videogames and jerkoff all day long."
I only avoid him by going to work but on my days off it's a party.
I am that guy a lot of the time.
I used to be super productive and stress out overwork.
I think Bourdain may still be alive if he would have spent more time doing nothing instead of  trying to catch the next thing all the time with strangers.
"I don't man, he's not so bad."
We're having a pretty good time together right now.
"For me that girl wants to be a stay at home mom who sells MLM and drinks a PSL with her jogging buddies but I work, cook amazing meals and hunt becuase I know I wouldnt truly be happy if I gave up the empowerment of making my own money and truly enjoying the things i want."
just do +reddit.
com at the end to only get results from reddit.
Hell you can even search subreddits with google +reddit.

This is a proof that bots are more efficient than humans.
"fuck you for being right, take this orange arrow"
*this meme was stolen*And thats a fact
I dunno.
I put “kids show penis” into the search bar on Reddit and the first result was exactly what I was looking for.

I thought this was common knowledge
reddit.
So true
There used to be searchreddit.

That is some China tier level shit.
What’s this meme template called?
Miss me with the subreddit bs.
If I’m looking for something I don’t have time to be digging through subreddits.
Just put <search query> Reddit and it does the job.

Now that’s alot of upvotes
What's the name of this format
115k upvotes and OP has 24.

Well yeah because then you dont havento searcg a subreddit for a post you want (like if your having an issue for a game its difficult to search all the posts for your issue) whereas you can just ggogle your issue and find a post and look at it
No use Ecosia
Not when it comes to cursed images
Or Ecosia.
roughly 90 seconds ago i googled ‘good conspiracy subreddit’ before running into this lmao
Can someone share the template?
Thanks
Ecosia is better than google though
Use Ecosia to save Forests!
Ecosia>Google
Ecosia is better lol

blake shelton?
brad paisley?
y’all are going to think i’m crazy.
but is there anyone out there that knows what i’m talking about?
please give literally any suggestions bc i want to know the song😂
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
Another fact template !
But duckduckgo \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Am I he only one that thinks all these blank slate memes are extremely low effort and all the same?
Seems like there's a new one every week but they all do the same thing.
Duck Duck Go forever.
Duckduckgo gang
This is the biggest act of karma whore I’ve seen today
But not when you need to search a user whose username doesnt start in capitals
Hmmm yes.
The floor isnt made out of floor
Very true.
"Even more so for metacritic, their own site search is so bad these days."
true tho
Old news
Never have I been so offended by something that I 100% agree with.
You have no idea how many times I have used Reddit to look for something instead of Google.
This is wonderland.
Now that's an avengers.
disaggree cuz to me reddit is the best socialmedia
Even bing search is better than reddit search
Google is also better to search for something on Amazon than Amazon is.
Not for me
"But for searching actual facts, Reddit is usually better"
"They can actually fix this with search engine optimization over time, while at the same time rethink the way results are shown, which can be validated using moderated testing, on actual redditros!"
That's how Google does it at least.
FACT.
and whats up with being thrown back to the begining with no chance of finding where you were crap?
that’s the facts jack!
Couldn't agree more :T
What about DuckDuckGo
Love the template
"They had us in the first half, not gonna lie"
r/technicallythetruth?
"I always search for stuff like ""best phone for 500$"" or  ""best graphics card"" on google and if i find nothing interesting i am adding reddit to The end."
It's true for nearly all websites that haven't invested millions into their products search algorithms.
Any time I look for help for anything I search on Google and add Reddit to the end of my inquiry.
Always helps
"Did someone forget ""they had us on the first half, not gonna lie"" question mark"
I find it baffling that the Reddit search is more likely to give me results of year-old unrelated posts than a very recent post that I used exact wording from.
Google bad!
Duckduckgo is better and privacy based.
Yeeeesss .
Thank u for thione!
facts
"After searching for what felt like hours for a certain movie discussion, this is good timing."
That's such a shame.
reddit.
"Except Google deliberately doesn't index certain subs, rendering them invisible."
google.

*suspicious.
You guys want to see me commit the equivilant of suicide on reddit?
@r/askreddit
"True, true."
Unless its something controversial.
"Despite reddits problems, there is still far more censorship on google than there is on reddit."
Maybe its not just the Chinese that are a threat to a free internet?
Truth
I just came
Maybe I’m just an idiot but I generally don’t have trouble searching for things on Reddit
Oh yea.
Reddit's search engine sucks.
This hurt my eye
They make a compelling argument.
"io/ is pretty good, by the way."
Oh come on ANOTHER version of the same meme?
Same for Amazon if you're looking for sex toys.
Not that I would know about that.
"Want to know something, yahoo it!"
"Dude, thats universal."
say DuckDuckGo right now
Google is better than everything to search for anything on everything
I use to just type a question in to google and see what came up.
now I do the same thing but just add reddit after it and immediately get 20 posts about the topic I’m looking for.
Unfortunately
"Pretty much, yeah."
Unless you just type in “freeloaders.
Can’t disagree with that
io I’ve found to be better than Google.
"I think that’s intentional, Reddit wants you to post again instead of finding old stuff"
When I want to find something on reddit I ask a question and just add reddit to the end of it on Google.
Works every time.
reddit is better than bing for searching anything.
which isn't saying much about reddits search function.
True tho.
I’ll search something in google and it’ll give me a reddit link
I searched cats and the first thing that came up was “my aunts cat is giant”.
You mean Duckduckgo right?
omg i thought i was the only weirdo doing this!
"Aye, 'tis true."
Also if you search Google on mobile and then try to use the reddit app rather than your browser it takes you to the fucking homepage of reddit.
Grrrr
And that's a fact!
I need this meme template all up in my life please and thank you
DuckDuckGo is best.
Facts
Most of the time I start to search something and the search help gives me what I'm looking for with Reddit at the end.
"I search something like: How to roam better r6, and it adds Reddit to the end of that due to the subreddit r/siegeacademy which I am now a part of."
Edit: bad at spelling.
"True, but I can say that it has improved."
Yes it is
Where is this from?
I always use Google to find the most popular sub for the thing I want to join
True lulw
I need more memes with this template
Even porn
"It is good for looking up reddit topics, but google sucks now for looking up anything that isn't extremely recent outside of that news wise."
I have to use duckduckgo if I want to find links to anything spiderman pre this week
They had the first half not gonna lie
BECAUSE STONE COLD SAID SO
That’s what I do when I want an opinion on something ______ + reddit.
I preffer duckduckgo
"2x the doggos, 2x the updoots"
I use the meme to search the meme
Thats why we say father is always father 😃
Well yes but actually yes
"Will start to do that, thanks"
I am never able to find my friend on reddit search so I have to physically search up u/ (his name) and get to his profile from there.
Only worked once through reddit.
"hmm i’ve seen this before, a long time ago"
Works best for porn.
true that
Does anyone have the meme template for this?
This is known Khaleesi.
Is anyone noticing its getting harder to find what you search for in google?
"I like that they split the first page with 50% ads/sponsored content and other half what you actually searched for too, great job google."
I love how I can't search anything in my saved posts.
I just have to scroll through eternity.
Is there a reason why reddit has a horrible search?
Bad programming?
Resource intensive?
"Google, a search engine, is better at searching than something that’s not a search engine."
Shocking.
Nah i think bing is better to search yahoo on which you search google to look at reddit
Couldnt agree more
"Like I'll do a search, set it to top/today and I won't be able to find it"
Replace Reddit on the sign with just about any website and it will still be true.
Except porn
And everybody liked it.
Why do people post such obvious bullshit.
and if someone ridicules them people r/woooosh them.
I mean are you really this lame?
@peopleofthisearth.
Google exists for that purpose.
to find stuff.
Reddit is not a search engine.
and that's a fact!
Putting ‘Reddit’ at the end of any practical or unconventional question is also better than doing a normal google search.
So what’s your point?
"That's true for nearly every site, btw."
Whatever I searched + reddit is always a gold mine
I was thinking why do people ask questions on here instead of google when you can get search results quckly and easily.
I mean for karma too.
And other people learning from the question.
And i answered half if not all my question.
"Google has gotten to the point where it auto-suggests ""reddit"" to the end of whatever I'm about to search because I do that so much 😂"
They had us in first half not gonna lie
"Reddit is great, but it's not perfect."
This is one of the reasons why.
USE DUCKDUCKGO FOR SEARCH
"Do we really need more meme formats that are just ""person or thing near or holding a sign?"
Is it even possible to look up a specific topic and not a subreddit in reddit?
It is true
Google is also better that the shitty search engines used in most forums
Grammar 100
"I literally look for phone or game issues on Google and add ""reddit"" to the end of my search to get good answers"
uhhh yes
I mean it’s a breathtaking community.
Agreed!
Y is this true!
searchreddit.
That’s how I found fucking gta updates
Blocks of text on signs or twitter aren't memesAnd that's a fact
Show me transvestite midget reality porn reddit
But you lose your data in the process
What‘s a google¿
*SMALL BRAİN*
That's a rock fact!
seriously tho who the fuck is in charge of reddit search its literally the worst thing out there.
Delete this
Someone needs to make a Firefox plugin that just adds reddit on the end of any search query.
what about duckduckgo?
To be fair Google is better at searching for anything anywhere than anything anywhere.
Hey I've seen this one before
Actually so true
And that's a fact!
Did it really have to be two dogs carrying a bannerk i’m not complaining
God fucking damn it it’s that time of the year again huh?
Except you get posts from 4 years ago with 6 upvotes and 3 comments.
Parkour!
And reddit is better than google for finding information from real humans.
I search what I want then add reddit at the end
"I'm new here and I've been guessing that, nothing like a meme to confirm something."
Oh you sweet summer children.
This is the better reddit search.
It was even *worse* before.
Nice 69.

One thing most cops probably don’t consider before their shift is that they’ll be tasing grandma over a broken taillight

This is why body cameras are important for police.
"In a situation of two parties making conflicting claims, the unbiased perspective of the (untampered with) camera will support the claims of the honest cop and make his job easier and safer, it has the added benefit of hamstringing the dishonest cop and minimizing the ease they find in abusing their power."

Old people finding out that laws apply to them is always a fun video.
What an entitled brat.
All politics aside.
If an officer gives an order that you don’t feel you need to comply with voice your objection while you comply.
If your rights are being violated you can sue the department after the fact.
"You can tell she's used to getting her way by being an obnoxious bitch, so that people won't want to deal with her."
"I still don't think she got her ass whooped hard enough, but I bet she'll sign the ticket next time."
"I just realized that handcuffs go all the way around, you don't have to open them then clip them,"
That was a satisfying taze.
I fought the law and the law won!
I'm an old lady but I think the officer did the right thing.
Age does not enable people to break the law.
Good for him.
Some of y'all seem to be misunderstanding how a traffic citation works.
Your signature is a promise to appear at court.
"If you refuse to sign, you go directly to jail to see a magistrate."
This is applicable in all US states.
"It's ok if she was trying to kick you, officer."
She's a country girl.

This is the best video I’ve seen in a while 🙌🏽🙌🏽
I live in Oklahoma.
I grew up in a rural town in Oklahoma.
This is normal.
The attitude I mean.
My brother married a girl from a small town in Oklahoma.
"When they divorced, her father held him down in his own home and spit on him and called him ""boy"" (she wasn't there)."
"At the divorce, her mother, who wasn't a witness, wouldn't stop arguing with the judge, who finally told her (and I will never forget this because it was so satisfying) ""Ma'am, sit down and be quiet, if I hear one more word from you I will have you removed from this court""."
"It's rare that a divorce in Oklahoma goes well for a male, but that was a good day."
Anywhoo.
"I'm interested in seeing how many ""back the blue"" stickers are on her truck, how many times she cheered for Trump when he said things like ""don't be gentle with criminals"" and shit like that."
"People here, especially people in rural towns here, they don't think in terms of legal or lawful."
"Not that they're criminals, mind you."
They just don't see themselves as criminals.
"Their minds can't comprehend, in a small town, that they can't just drive away."
"It's very much ""Jessie Miller you put that ticket away this \*instant\* or I will call your mother!"
"""Don't get me wrong, there's not some crime syndicate of older white people or anything like that, it's just that good 'old boy/girl thing."
Entitlement for days.
"It's a believe that the cops are here to corral the teenagers and keep the ""others"" out; not to police \*ME\*."
I go to church!
I raised three kids in this town!
It sucks.
All things considered that actually ended rather peacefully with her being able to have a relatively normal conversation about it.
Seems like she realized she messed up.
"Officer: ""you hurt?"
"""Lady: ""Yes I'm hurt!"
"""Officer: ""What hurts?"
"""Lady: ""Everything!"
""" Me (rather loudly): ""well then next time you'll obey a lawful order huh?"
"This is the type of woman who says things like ""respect your elders"" and ""you gotta give respect to get it"""
She deserved every single moment of what happened to her.
Well that was a shit show.
I’m not under arrest absolute power move
"""you're under arrest."
"""""no im not"""
”I don’t think I should have to pay for something that’s fixable!
"” Honey, what world do you live in?"
You gonna have to pay to fix your car one way or the other.
Stupid!
"As a general rule, when people with guns tell you to things, you do them unless you want to get shot or shoot back, regardless of minor details like police uniforms."
Did she think that saying “no” to a police officer arresting her would work?
This is the type of stuff that pisses me off .
"I don’t agree with EVERYTHING police do & it’s a fact they have been abusive towards citizens , but this is just stupidity ."
Honestly abusing the police if you ask me .
"They’re just doing their job a lot of the time , and this lady was asking for it ."
She made it x2 harder on herself for being ignorant .
Tickets & fines happen .
Getting physical with the police should not .
"That was fun, but I kinda enjoyed how they talked it out at the end."
"He gave her a Lawful order, but little did he know she's Chaotic Neutral with a -2 modifier in Intelligence."
Did anyone else get a chuckle when she plopped to the ground?
I work in customer service.
It's always cute old ladies that are so mean
"I’ll take “How not to talk to a cop” for $500, Alex"
Boomer entitlement at 100%
Somebody give that man his donut!
Getting arrested?
Just say no!
The police legally can not arrest you now.
EM: You didn't have to tase me.
Cop: Yes I Did.
You refused to comply and then you tried to kick me - yes I did have to tase you.
"EM: I did try to kick you, cuz I'm a country girl."
"""you be fair with me and I'll be fair with you."
""" *refuses to pay ticket for legitimate crime and resists arrest*"
Not gonna lie.
That was pretty satisfying to watch.
“OHH U BETTER MAKE ME.
” *tzzztzttztzz*
“I’m a country girl.
”I wonder if this argument will hold up in court.
Maybe with the right judge.
"Can imagine her being led into a penitentiary and the officer shouting ‘COUNTRY GIRL COMING THRU, WE GOT OURSELVES A BONAFIDE COUNTRY GIRL’"
Canadian here.
How does it go from refusing to sign a ticket to being under arrest so quickly?
Are you required by law to sign it?
Response is pretty textbook.
"Maybe a case could be levelled for excessive use of force, but not much more than that."
The case would unlikely go anywhere given that there is video evidence of her resisting arrest.
What's right and what's legal are two different things.
Can you immediately back off and sign the ticket after cop told her that she commited a crime.
Or is there no way back once she declined the first time?
"""But don't I get a warning?"
"""""Its been 6 months """"But."
"""Hahaha"
“ you’re gonna get it again!
“ lol
Love how he already knows there's gonna be a next time
It's videos like these that just show the difference in entitlement.
Most black drivers would never give that much pushback and they get in a lot worse situations that this lady.
Lady just assumes the law does not apply to her.
Shaking my headEdit: Thank you to the kind stranger who gave me my first ever gold!
I'm so proud of this community.
"Serious Tone: I can say i pretty much relate to this picture, and i can tell that reddit had help me out with my depression."

wait til you guys see the people on twitter
I am on reddit and have crippling depression but I'm ok because I know I will take my revenge on the world by nuking it
Reddit is trash and instagram is also trash.
People on Reddit always comment with how bad they're depressed.
There are 10+ subreddits with memes about it too.
I m new in reddit 😅
Both aren’t that great
Reddit ain’t better.
Reddit is more toxic than instagram

People use the term depressed too loosely on Reddit.
Without even being diagnosed with depression they say they have it.
They are no better than 14 year old girls who listen to Billie Elish.
Now if you actually went to a doctor and are diagnosed then that is a different story.
I agree.
"My thing with social media since I was a teen, was always feeling bad for not having the most followers or a lot of friends."
I was also a lazy teen and didn't care to check them that often.
"Reddit is awesome because not only do I not know any of you guys, I don't care about you either!"
It's like a win-win.
"I've talked to some amazing people on Reddit and have DM'd some people who I swear know me better than I know me, because they've been where I am, mentally."
I love Reddit.
"I know that's probably taboo to say, but I love it."
I don't see ads nor am I the type of person that Gallowboobs obvious ads would work on.
Reddit has helped me figure out myself.
It's been there for me on hard times.
"It's helped me get my finances in order, it's helped me ask for a raise, but it's also been there when I've been sad and depressed."
"It cheered me up, it made me see things differently."
"I don't care about the company behind Reddit, I just love this child that they've made."
Depressed losers unite!
This is so tue.
Since I have reddit I don't selfharm anymore.
I look at a few memes and I feel almost happy.
"Honestly, I feel like the anonymizing aspect of Reddit makes for a healthier experience."
"On Facebook and other ""real name / real face"" sites, there's this fake element of ""people"" ""liking"" ""you,"" and it leads to mass consumption of fake social nutrients."
"You may think you have friends, but they're just fake internet friends, and you may think they like you, but they're just clicking ""Like,"" and your brain can ultimately tell the difference."
"On Reddit, it's just numbers and aliases."
"Nobody gives a shit about *me* on Reddit, and they don't pretend to."
I like that.
"you gotta admit this is actually true, I log in on the website/app called instagram, the depressed people are also very toxic, they also use snapchat and instagram filters, Reddit is so much better"
This meme is God in the form of an image
People on insta are fake depressed
So simple but so true
*Laughs in suicidal thoughts*
"Yes, instagram is full of whiners while redditors are like whiskey."
accurate
Another meme about depression - someone give it a bunch of awards.

Instagram does literally the same stuff.
I hate how reddit users think their soecial
Yeah right.
Visit r/suicidewatch and see how “happy” those people are.
Fuck outta here.
There are a lot of Redditors who *think* they’re depressed.
reddit>instagram
I’m kind of annoyed by that little brown dot on the right of the second slide
Don't forget Instagram people would also try to sell you something.
Hell yeah!
I'm both.
That's true.
Never seen anything more true lol
It really do be that way
What is an Instagram?
I am depressed.
**SUDDENLY PINEAPPLES**This does not help.
What about tumblr?
I totally agree because Reddit makes me happier

I come to Reddit when I'm sad and need a laugh.
Everyone on reddit is depressed

Ah man that's hot
Damn imagine having 30000 upvotes in 2 hours
It’s true tho.

Probably because your posts don’t  have to rely on you and how popular you are.
Anything can reach hot.

"Joking about my depression always makes me feel better, and reddit seems to be much more jokey and fun community."
So true !
Yes reddit is better because we hide our inevitably harmful emotions till we have a reason to expose the fact that we do in fact have nothing to live for other than the irreplaceable vibe of the reddit community.
oh yes
It's like the depression makes the memes spicier or something.
Can't explain it.
Hey the second one looks just like me!
Get epic trolled NORMIE instagrammer xdxdxd
I feel like that guy in the second picture as soon as I turn on reddit
It’s better because there are more people who have the same issues as you and will talk to you about them
Visit us at r/depression for a reality check boys and girls.
There is a comprehensive amount of happy stories too but still.
Sense
Reddit’s suicidewatch sub saved my life when I was at my lowest point.
Wrote 3 suicide notes and sat down to cry and reddit came to mind.
I looked up any post relating to suicide and it brought so much relief to my life knowing that folks all around the world were going through similar issues.
I also loved reading other folk who shared their stories about suicide and being glad to be alive today.
It was heartwarming.
I threw my notes away and I’m happy to be alive today too.
Let’s get some statistics out here: does use of reddit help depression?
Because I thought social media makes you sadder
The shirt says cop so you know better
"I agree for the most part, but I have for sure seen some comments that were extremely concerning on Reddit."
"Luckily, you almost always see other redditors offering immediate support!"
As a daily Instagram user I must say that Reddit really seems like a way better option than Instagram.
"I started using Reddit couple weeks ago and it's such a pleasure not seeing bunch of kids commenting random copy paste stuff, ads or even bots with their chain comments and generally the community seems more mature."
"Main reasons of me sticking with Instagram for so long is that Reddit isn't so popular in my local area and I'm bad at getting used to new stuff, but here I am now so wish me luck."
"And what shocked me is the fact that Instagram pages steal so many memes from Reddit, because I knew that was happening but I never knew it happens so often."
"Anyway, I'm sorry for a paragraph I just wrote but I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am for finally deciding to change from Instagram to Reddit."
Thats the real logic of live
All facts No BS
Can Relate
"Well, I'm not depressed."
But I'm sure people that are depressed in reddit are like this
Its very accurate (for me)
This makes no sense.
I am in this meme and i like it
Please put quotes around the instagram depressed
Can relate.
Super depressed currently.
Life doesn't sound fun.
"Honestly, I love how Reddit memes about depression are less sad than funny unlike Instagram."
Putting a funny spin on depression just makes it a bit more bearable to me.
There should be an emoticon somewhere.
But seriously tho depression is a big fucking problem
This is true.
You might wanna include fb as well along with instagram in the upper panel
This Is true.
I'm both bruh
Depression so fumny!
It really isn't lmao.
"You gotta look out for anyone depressed though, doesn’t matter what platform they prefer I guess."
Instagram makes me feel more shitty being left out on things.
Every one downvote me or else
How much karma do i need to post on r/memes
Isn't everyone depressed
God I can’t wait til summer Reddit is overoh wait it’s tomorrow :D
He deserved the Platinum
Fuck plebbit desu
"I'm not depressed, your depressed, stop interagtin me damn he's good at this"
Take my upvote.
You win
yeah that’s pretty accurate.
this might me the truest meme today
Yeah this is big brain time
"That's some wholesome shit, I wish some random redditor would help me with my depression"
FACTS
Wouldn’t you have that moment of extreme joy when depressed
Being depressed is free karma
Golden for reddit
Its because reddit jokes about depression and instagram normies are just edgy 14 year olds that actually think they have depression
Well they got a point
Oh boiiii.
you make my day.
Thanks
The amount of people that upvoted this post is almost the same amount of Americans that died in Vietnam.

I only just got Reddit but Jesus this is so much better than Instagram
I dont get this meme because I dont use instagram
Can relate
They are entirely different platforms
I rate this
When life gives you lemons

Jokes on you I don't know what Reddit is
Ah yes enslaved depression.
Imagine being this fucking shallow
Instagram normies.
Lets get this post to 69.
"Luigi says: if your emotions are loose, just tie the noose."
Ngl this deserves plat tho
Fuckin-A!
Repressing emotions FTW!
High five everyone!
Karma all round.
It's the same on both platforms
This is the first one in this format that actually made me laugh out loud.
fucking cringe
Why suck your own dick so much?
Reddit cures depression

Wait he has 12k ish karma but this post alone has 70k.
I feel so bad for you this meme is amazing
You have done well child
I have a feeling this will end when the s'more schnapps dries up.
"That ""Locked up for what?"
""" sign gave me a laugh."
“There are DOZENS of us!
"They barely have enough people to raid molten core, Area 51 might be a bit ambitious."
Looks like there's.
51 people.
Will they raid or chill?
Note found at Area 51 after the raid -Thanks for the F Shack.
"Love,Dirty Mike and the Boys."
Where's LeeRoy Jenkins when you need him?
“Clap alien cheeks” represent.
Ah hah!
The North Koreans are the true masterminds behind the raid!
I really don't think waving a NK flag outside a US military base is a great idea
"Of all the people I have met in my life, those 25 guys are the ones I knew were the type that would make it to this kind of event."

And no deodorant was harmed that day.
That doesn't look like a million people.
"Dozens of them, everyone."

2 Dozens.
I thought the Area 51 raid was actually going to be attended by paranoid anarchist paramilitary types.
Turns out it's just a Gen.
Z meme rally of people camping miles outside the base.
This could not have turned out better for everyone involved lol.
Is that a North Korean flag?
Why go to Area 51?
Everyone knows that the Stargate is at Cheyenne Mountain.
You know what I am sure the US military loves to see?
People storming your base with a North Korean flag flying.
A North Korean flag?
I'm confused.
People who are surprised that people showed up for a meme rally are seriously underestimating the human collective to be part of something.
The same thing happened in Philly this year for the r/furnaceparty.
Some guy wrote a weird note and put it of people's door telling them so show up at an empty lot to be dipped in a hot furnace and hundreds of people showed up and turned it into a party.
Fuck yeah.
I bet my friend a tab that at least 200 people will show up.
Don't let me down!
why y’all being so mean?
they’re just having fun.
it’s fricken hilarious.
Legends say they were killed immediately

"Everyone making fun of how they look like or how dumb it would be to actually try to storm it but honestly, those guys probably have a better day than I had today and will have a great story to tell for a long time."
"Really I think it would be fun to be there, you just have to stop judging for a little bit."
Why aren't they all Naruto running?
As expected a big group of idiots who were able to get the day off at gamestop.
"Edit: Jesus, you are literally a walking, talking meme and if we make fun of you, we're the dicks?"

So when exactly did reddit turn into a bunch of jaded baby boomers who apparently couldn't tell that the entire event was a joke in the first place?
"They're probably having more fun than we are, cool your engines and stop acting like you're a fucking genius for knowing raiding a military base is a bad idea."
"We know, they know; they aren't actually going to do it."

r/madladsNice.
Enjoying this thread of people sat on Reddit frantically shitting on other people who were down for something they found fun and had the freedom to do it
People are watching this like how rednecks watch nascar.
Pretending to like it but secretly there to watch the crashes.
ONE OF THOSE SIGNS SAYS CLAP ALIEN CHEEKS AND I AM JUST SO PROUD OF US RIGHT NOW
"I have issues with the guys throwing ""Live Long and Prosper"" signs up."
"To be doing this ""raid"" is highly illogical."
I've always wanted to buy a North Korean flag for historical purposes but I feel like I'd get put on some kind of list
Anyone have a link to the sub for everything involving this momentous occasion?
That clap alien cheeks raider is a legend.
LMAOOOOO the North Korean flag!
You are by far the worst raiders I've ever heard of.
"The guards just need to lob cans of Redbull and Juul pods over the fence, and they'll be fine."
Holy shit it’s actually happening
I’ve never just hung out in front of a dungeon with my guild.
This ain’t no raid
Burning Man 2.
I know they won't but I really wish the military would play along and drive out a humvee with a blow up alien with handcuffs on and throw him out as an offering for peace
This is EXACTLY what I expected them to look like.
I watched a livestream of this and the most notable person there was the brother of the Olsen twins and Elizabeth Olsen.
What an interesting life in the shadows this guy must have lived.
I’d love for him to do an AMA.
Seems he’s best friends with the guy in the photo wearing the red headband who was hosting the stream and he was filming for him.
It seems sickeningly appropriate that the international climate strike and the area 51 raids be going on in the same period of time.
"Look at the shadows, the pavem6 is kit behind that 1 row."
It's a lineup for a picture not a group hoping to raid anything.
"What if amost of the members are actually disguised officers that infiltrated the army and there are only 500 of the real ones left, then when the raid starts, the raiders gets their ass cheeks clapped"
The North Korean flag is a nice touch.
I did not think this was for real.
This is about what I expected the crowd to look like.
I see dear leader made an appearance.
"Tracer is gay, so they already look bad in China's eyes."
Mei'd in China
I love Overwatch and it's sad that I'm gonna stop playing it to support the boycott
"I've been surfing reddit the past hour or so, looking for Hong Kong Mei on different subreddits, and upvoting."
"it's not much, but it's honest work."
"I like how this is turning on blizzard :)edit: it's 'hong kong' not 'hong honk' -sry, I blame it on autocorrect"
"I think we should make ""ten cents"" a meme for Chinese democracy too."
"They can ban characters, pooh bear and a bunch of other stuff but lets see them try banning money and the name of one of their biggest companies."
Lets make this happen too!
Me living in China: *chuckles* I'm in danger
Get mei-mei'd
Let's fucking **boycott** those **motherfuckers**.

Thanks guys so much for all the upvotes!
It was a surprise after not being on Reddit for a few hours.
Just wanted to say not to give me any more medals as the money spent on Reddit coins goes towards the Chinese corporations that have shares in this site.
Thanks 🙂
Let's go big.
Let's get every company affiliated with Tencent banned.
"Fuck Epic Games, fuck Riot Games, fuck Activision, fuck Ubisoft, fuck Blue Hole, fuck Discord."
Congrats on getting to r/all

What game was it for?
The tournament
We are going to need to keep this momentum going even after the boycott is over if we really want to make a difference.
"Half this fucking thread just says ""Mei-d in China."
I actually needed a reason to stop playing and this is a good fucking reason
"Should make it out of the old british flag, further piss off the chinese"

Free Hong Kong
Here I am from China.
Surprised to see so many young people concerned with Hong Kong issues.
Is reddit banned in China?
This Will do the trick if not
what happened with blizzard and china?
i see the posts everywhere but i dont know what happened
I would like to ask everyone here who is canceling a subscription to blizzard to NOT REACTIVATE after they formally givenan apology to gloss over this terrible action.
They will only be listening to third pocketbook with their response.
The message they preach was shown the moment an American company decided to restrict speech for a global community.
Don't just forget about this and allow them to be another IBM or Fanta.
Let them die as they deserve.
"Don't worry about your games, they lose enough money and they will sell."
Another will host the games.
Id assume that the issue was with tencent owning about 6% of blizzard and them probably forcing blizz into yeeting him.

Even Thanos couldn't eat that sandwich
You two are stupid.

"If I should ever decide again to jump, that is how I will do it."
"honestly thats a pretty efficient method,  it gives him a little more hang time on the gate  incase he sees lava or something on the other side he can then pounce off the gate  and climb thin air out of there"
r/bettereveryloopI could watch this all day.
Such grace.
Such fluff.
And yet my cat stares and meows at me till I pick her up and put her up to where she wants to go.
God forbid I put her on the wrong shelf.

Serious Olympic-form Cat jumping.

Pure elegance
I did a slomo video of my cat where he jumps up on the bed and lands on his back paws like that and uses them to power through.
His front paws never touched my bed until he tagged my hand.
It's crazy how agile and cats are.
Like that motion makes the most sense but I wouldn't have believed it had I not seen it.
I don’t think I’ve laughed that immediately at something truly unexpected in a while.
Mesmerizing
That cat gets some serious cat action
I imagine an old timy Olympic athlete doing “hiiiiiiiiyup!
"It's funny how after it completes that impressive, graceful jump, it just continues to walk away like saying ""no big deal, it was easy, I do this all the time."
Perfect!
Very satisfying indeed.
clearly not the first time it's pulled that off!
Purrfect execution
Does the cat have short legs?
Looks like Totoro waiting for the bus when he stands on the gate
That cat is actually a super hero and you just caught him during a lazy moment.
Made even more perfect because you can see her do a three-count bob before going over.
Floof purrection.
you can say you're  cool all you want.
you'll never be be Cat Cool
Reminded me of something.
Watched at lest eight times 😁Need some kind person to repost it at a slower frame rate.
My blind kitty jumps like this.
Its a less risky jump.
My cat thinks it's pretty hot.
I could watch this all day!
And how the cat sticks the landing.
Awesome
That is the cute fuckin thing I have seen all week!
"Jump smarter, not harder."
is there a slow-mo bot?
The cats eyes have me dying!

I give ia 10/10 for sticking it

Going for that Assasins Creed swan dive.
that cat is a gamer.
Reminds me of King Tommen
Is it a munchkin cat?
Is it because it's legs are short or something?
"Such poise atop the rail for that second, then a fall but landing gracefully."
Never seen that before.
What a cute cat.
That’s a Totoro move right there
u/heyjinji
My favorite part is the little tap by the front paws on the top of the gate as he/she is going up
It’s like a hot potato being ignited out of a chute

"Oh Jinxy cat, Robert De Niro has taught you well."
"She didn't want to get her front paws dirty, cats are such divas, LOL"
Can someone make this so that there is a line of cats jumping up one after the other?
Graceful
Hahahhaaa I love this!
I legit giggled at this silly cat
u/gifreversingbot
The double jump!
"That's a Siamese ragdoll, I had one that jumped the exact same way and so did a friend of mine."
I think it might be a ragdoll cat thing.
Playing What’s New Pussycat?
on Spotify greatly enhances the loop.
u/GifReversingBot
That’s a Pfoomt right there!
r/Pfoomt
Thant’s because the cat is a munchkin breed therefore it has short legs.
u/Hellbare
Beep beep!
I'm all about top posts!
r/BetterEveryLoop
Pussy cat with hydraulic suspension legs.
Anyone got a slow-mo?
I love how the cat pauses for a second on the gate and such a graceful jump!
It jumped up normally then decided to 'fall' (gracefully) due to forced stance.
Wasn't really an awkard jump up nor down.
r/bettereveryloop
The walk afterwards is even more satisfying to me than the jump for some reason lol
They don't call them ragdoll cats for nothing
It’s adorable how she pumps herself up in the beginning.
This made my bummed out mom laugh harder than she's laughed in a long timeBless you for this post

With the grace of an Olympian.
This makes me laugh.
Such a proper kitty.

"I wonder if other cats see him and just think, what the fuck did we just watch?"
I picture a Mario jump sound effect going with that jump
Give this cat a medal.

A little too much feet shuffle at the start.
That was so fucking majestic

That was so graceful
So how the fuck is it supposed to jump then?
My planet ne.

I would do anything for that cat
De-deeerp
Hilarious!
I’m free falling
Such grace
To Infinity and BEYOND!
That’s a hard flex.

I love the two little squats getting ready to pounce
Those little hops right before he jumps!
Scientific respectful human cat
Purrkour
They need to incorporate that jump style into a game.
OFF THE TOP ROPE!
That trot afterwards
You’re not even trying.
"The payoff is too good I guess but holy shit, your sense of pride must be based on next to nothing."
Can't wait to see the full routine at Tokyo 2020.
That little tap on the top of the gate with the front paws on the way up.
Send her to high jump event at olympics.
Korin taught him well
Funny.
I have the same breed cat and she jumps just like that.
/u/GIFSpeedBot 0.
What the hahahahahahahaha awesome
Looks like a Miyazaki side villain
that cat is clearly on its way to fuck like 3 other cats.
what a god damn baller.
Highly refined.
Straight to the top little friend!
10/10 stuck the landing
And then there's my cat who reckons she's a squirrel
r/whatswrongwithyourdog
Fancy jump for a fancy cat.
I really like the form at the apex of the jump and the perfect height not to high or low.
This is great!
I love cats
That’s so cute!
I want to believe this cat doesn‘t just want to get over the fence but wants to do it with some style.
"Pls don‘t try to convince me otherwise, thx."
smooth
Anyone remember the video of the cat tryna do that and falling
I love the way the cat pumps him/herself up before jumping
"My cat can barely figure out how to jump out of a small cardboard box, and this mother fucker jumps with style."
It’s-a me!
that is steez
Boing!
noice
Double jump
I 100% thought he was going to faceplant.
Could watch this all dayPurrfect form and execution.
This is going straight to the top
So great.
Thanks for sharing.
That's so freaking cute
I watched it 9 times
i’ve watched this a million times .
this is amazing
This is something I'd see in The Life Of Pets.
Cute movie btw if anyone hasnt seen it lol
Funny?
Cute?
Satisfying?
My conclusion: Your cat is a show-off
CATKOUR
Mario style.
How is this not on r/slygifs lol
I could watch him do this all day.
He just gently falls forward.
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day!
I have a baby gate and every time my cat’s fat ass jumps over it she knocks it down.
That was a beautiful house too.
Sorry dawg
"On a second thought, my day wasn't as bad as I think"
That sucks.
I have rebuilt 6 diffrent homes due to the wild fires in California.
I recommend do not take the insurance payout until the last nail is in.
Alot of people took the payout and to build with modern codes it was not enough money.
"Sorry to hear about that, thats shitty."
"but literally read this a couple hours ago and thought you might like to read it too, seeing as how it is rather applicable at the moment for youHere's a useful comment I've saved from /u/0102030405 Hey OP."
"I used to be the guy who worked for insurance companies, and determined the value of every little thing in your house."
The guy who would go head-to-head with those fire-truck-chasing professional loss adjusters.
I may be able to help you not get screwed when filing your claim.
"Our goal was to use the information you provided,  and give the lowest damn value we can possibly justify for your item."
"For instance, if all you say was ""toaster"" -- we would come up with a cheap-as-fuck $4."
"88 toaster from Walmart, meant to toast one side of one piece of bread at a time."
And we would do that for every thing you have ever owned.
"We had private master lists of the most commonly used descriptions, and what the cheapest viable replacements were."
"We also had wholesale pricing on almost everything out there, so really scored cheap prices to quote."
"To further that example:-  If you said ""toaster - $25""  , we would have to be within -20% of that."
"so, we would find something that's pretty much dead-on $20."
"-  If you said ""toaster- $200"" , we'd kick it back and say NEED MORE INFO, because that's a ridiculous price for a toaster (with no other information given."
")   -  If you said ""toaster, from Walmart"" , you're getting that $4."
88 one.
"-  If you said ""toaster, from Macys"" , you'd be more likely to get a $25-35 one."
"-  If you said ""toaster"", and all your other kitchen appliances were Jenn Air / Kitchenaid / etc."
", you would probably get a matching one."
"-  If you said ""Proctor Silex 42888 2-Slice Toaster from Wamart, $9"", you just got yourself $9."
"-  If you said ""High-end Toaster, Stainless Steel, Blue glowing power button"" ."
you might get $35-50 instead.
We *had* to match all features that were listed.
I'm not telling you to lie on your claim.
Not at all.
"That would be illegal, and could cause much bigger issues (i."
", invalidating the entire claim)."
"But on the flip side, it's not always advantageous to tell the whole truth every time."
Pay attention to those last two examples.
I remember one specific customer.
"he had some old, piece of shit projector (from mid-late 90s) that could stream a equally piece of shit consumer camcorder."
Worth like $5 at a scrap yard.
"It had some oddball fucking resolution it could record at, though -- and the guy *strongly insisted* that we replace with ""Like Kind And Quality"" (trigger words)."
"Ended up being a $65k replacement, because the only camera on the market happened to be a high-end professional video camera (as in, for shooting actual movies)."
"$65-goddam-thousand-dollars because he knew that loophole, and researched his shit."
Remember to *list fucking every* -- even the most mundane fucking bullshit you can think of.
"For example, if I was writing up the shower in my bathroom:-  Designer Shower Curtain  -  $35-  Matching Shower Curtain Liner for Designer Shower Curtain - $15-  Shower Curtain Rings x20 - $15-  Stainless Steel Soap Dispenser for Shower - $35-  Natural Sponge Loofah - from Whole Foods - $15-  Natural Sponge Loofah for Back - from Whole Foods - $19-  Holder for Loofahs - $20-  Bars of soap - from Lush - $12 each (qty: 4)-  Bath bomb - from Lush - $12-  High end shampoo - from salon - $40-  High end conditioner - from salon - $40-  Refining pore mask - from salon - $55I could probably keep thinking, and bring it up to about $400 for the contents of my shower."
"Nothing there is ""unreasonable""  , nothing there is clearly out of place, nothing seems obviously fake."
"The prices are a little on the high-end, but the reality is, some people have expensive shit -- it won't actually get questioned."
"No claims adjuster is going to bother nitpicking over the cost of fucking Lush bath bombs, when there is a 20,000 item file to go through."
"The adjuster has other shit to do, too."
Most people writing claims for a total loss wouldn't even bother with the shower (*it's just some used soap and sponges.
*)  -- and those people would be losing out on $400.
Some things require documentation & ages.
"If you say ""tv - $2,000""  -- you're getting a 32"" LCD, unless you can provide it was from the last year or two w/ receipts."
Hopefully you have a good paper trail from credit/debit card expenditure / product registrations / etc.
If you're missing paper trails for things that were legitimately expensive -- go through every photo you can find that was taken in your house.
"Any parties you may have thrown, and guests put pics up on Facebook."
"Maybe an Imgur photo of your cat, hiding under a coffee table you *think* you purchased from Restoration Hardware."
Like.
seriously.
"come up with any evidence you possibly can, for anything that could possibly be deemed expensive."
"The fire-truck chasing loss adjusters are evil sons of bitches, but, they actually do provide some value."
"You will definitely get more money, even if they take a cut."
"But all they're really doing, is just nitpicking the ever-living-shit out of everything you possibly owned, and writing them all up ""creatively"" for the insurance company to process."
"Sometimes people would come back to us with ""updated* claims."
"They tried it on their own, and listed stuff like ""toaster"", ""microwave"", ""tv"" ."
and weren't happy with what they got back.
"So they hired a fire-truck chaser, and re-submitted with ""more information."
"""  I have absolutely seen claims go from under $7k calculated, to over $100k calculated."
"(It's amazing what can happen when people suddenly ""remember"" their entire wardrobe came from Nordstrom."
That drive way is beautiful
"Wow, so sorry."
it was beautiful.
Any idea what happened?
House fires fuckin terrify me.
All my stuff is in there.
What size do you wear in shirts and pants?
Got some clothes I was gonna donate.
"I'd love to send you some, free of charge."
"Also, my girlfriend has clothes to donate as well."
"If you have a cat or dog, we have extra pet stuff."
"Edit: Thanks for the silver, stranger."
My house burned down when I was a kid.
"We were in it, managed to jump out of the second story window."
Crazy.
Hope you and your fam are okay.
"recovery takes a while, but at least ya'll are around for it."
Almost back in mine after a devastating fire in October.
"You will be ok, just takes a little while"
Did you get the spider
reddit.
Some where on Reddit is a piece written by an insurance adjuster about how to file your insurance claim for what you lost.
"You need to read that post, several times."
I can't seem to find it.
Does someone know where this post is?
I am so sorry.
Hope no one was injured.
So that's where I left my new mixtape
"Using that last bit of wifi right to the end, I see."
Your router is like those musicians on the Titanic.
I read in your previous post that a gas line burst  which caused the fire?
Any indication that the line broke; did you have a gas detector?
Glad that it seems like you were all able to make it safely out.
Where you home at the time?
Asking as someone with two really young kids and who also owns an older home with gas.
Just want to say I’m so sorry.
"My parents lost our house to a fire when I was 5, lost all my baby pictures."
My mom took videos of me every month of my first couple years and they were lost to water damage in the basement.
I can’t imagine what she felt going through that.
She passed away from cancer in October.
I wish nothing but prosperity in your life from here on.
Please take care and message me if you need to speak or vent.
Your not alone ❤️
"well, thats unfortunate"
**Update**: We finally started scheduling demolition of the house.
"After demo, comes rebuild."
"Its been a crazy, depressing and challenging experience but things are starting to look up."
"Thanks everyone that reached out, offered advice or just wanted to say they are hoping for the best."
"I did get bombarded with responses, so if i haven't responded to you - I apologize"
Oh no!
Call the insurance company.
they may be able to put you up in a hotel.
Somebody please link to that comment where they explain how to get the most out of insurance
What happened?
If it's any consolation( which I'm sure its not) it's a well taken photo and is actually kind of beautiful.
sorry.
I truly hope everyone is okay.

Sorry friend.
At least you got a shit ton of magic internet points though?
bruh use cobblestone next time smh
This blows.
Looks like it was so nice too.
That driveway is sexy.
My worst fear.
At least that nice brick driveway is fine
"Hey man, I really hope you are alright!"
Things can only go up.
lost my fav dog yesterday it sucks shit honestly.
Losing anything of value
OP: Fuck my house it on fire OP’s Reddit addiction: FREE KARMA
I hope you got the spider.
Mission accomplished.
Is this about what it looked like?
Something tells me you have an optimistic personality posting this under “well that sucks.
Well look at the bright sideYou get to spend more time with family and friends now and you’re alive.
Could be much much worse although watching your home go down in flames is not good.
Did you make sure everyone including any pets got out?
If you have neighbors nearby start warning them.
Once the fire department arrives and checks you out you should make a few phone calls to let people know what happened and that you’re okay.
Thats lit
Just wanted to compliment you on your driveway.
It really is a nice driveway.
Hopefully your driveway is alright.
That thing is a masterpiece.
Congrats on infinite premium
"i know its an old post, legit sorry for the house burn my man."
glad its being rebuilt soon
That’s a well maintained lawn.
"Man, the things some people will do just for some karma."
Edit: apparently people didn't think me saying that OP burned his own house down for karma was all that funny.
"I'm so sorry, OP :( do you have a GoFundMe or anything?"
"I don't have much, but I have $5 and I want you to have it."
Edit: yoo wtf is everyone's problem?
"I have $5, and I don't care how ""rich"" OP might be, I want the dude to have it."
Because my house isn't in effing ashes right now and everything I own didn't just go up in flames.
I STILL CHOOSE TO GIVE OP MY WHOPPING $5.
Thanks
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
That's awful.
Best of luck.
Sorry :/
Sorry for your loss!
Hope everyone is okay.
Good luck to you all.
Isn’t it strange that it burned down and burned up?
That’s horrible.
"Also, amazing pavers."
That really sucks dude.
"Hope you’re able to recover, my full sympathy is with you man."
"Sorry for the loss of your house, I hope everyone is ok"
At least the driveway will still look good
How can we help?
"That’s fucked yo, sorry"
Was about to comment well that sucks but.
"Well, that sucks"
That’s must suck.
On the bright side that’s a pretty nice photo you took there!
Stole this from the Fahrenheit 451 post!
Good luck OP.
I’m sorry that happened to you.

"Wow, I just saved this comment a few hours ago."
reddit.
"I hope you didn’t lose too muchI’m sure this comment is in this thread several times already but hey, can’t hurt to try to get it to you a bit more"
Sorry to hear that.
Did you at least get the spider?
"just a heads up - lots of companies will come after you to help negotiate with insurance, fence off the site, recover property etc."
for a % of the settlement.
Dont sign contracts while you are in shock.
Happened to a friend of mine.
Sharks out there.
Got a pretty good picture of it tho kudos
My house burned down about two months ago.
I feel for you.
Hopefully everyone made it out safely.
"Kumbaya, my lord."
"On the bright side, your house."
At least you have this picture to remember it by as the rest of your belongings perish in the flames.
"Sorry OP, condolences."
"Feel free to contact the red cross if you need any supplies, they always help out people who lost their homes to a fire"
Are you and family okay?
Your driveway looks nice
"You don’t have to lie, we all hate spiders too."
Did you get the spider?
Welp.
Glad the government cant find all your secret documents anymore.
Win win I'd say.
Only way to get rid of the spiders I hear.
I hope you and all of your family is ok.
Furry friends too.
It looks like this post is about Politics.

"*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
He's our tiny wizard President.
He waits in line at atms.
He buys people ice-cream.
"He speaks up, loudly, for the downtrodden."
He's a poet and a University professor.
His name is Michael D.
"Higgins, or as he's affectionately known (because a child on tv called him this) Miggledy."
"Being Irish, our Presidential Vote is more like, ""Who here looks most like what you think the president of Ireland looks like."
Pretty sure that dude is from Gringotts
"From what I hear from a few Irish streamers, he's a pretty cool chap to boot."
"He's an amazingly intelligent, thoughtful, and well spoken man."
"Also, he has two Burmese mountain dogs, who basically worship him."
He's awesome.

A tribute to how great Mickey D is.

And Larry David
Bilbo Baggins ended up as president of Ireland.
How can you not love this guy.
Someone please tell me he's as wholesome as he looks.
"It could make for a good episode of IASIP for Frank to find out his brother from Ireland is visiting Paddy’s pub, but it’s just Danny playing an Irish version of Frank."
"Hijinks ensue, the gang fails miserably at understanding Irish culture and Dee gets called a bird."
Might be fun.
Mickey D is twice the legend of both.
"You leave our Miggeldy alone, he's precious."

youtube.
Danny Devito playing Penguin playing Bernie Sanders
"Every time I see miggeldy I develop a cork accent and yell ""hon the bai"" no matter where I am tru fact"
"Tbh, he kind of is a Bernie Sanders."
He has done a huge amount of social work and helping those that need helping.
In Ireland and in the United States.
"When he went for the election, he won by an almost a landslide."
Hmmm.
He's an aging leprechaun.
"There was a mad story maybe a year or two ago where this woman who was a housing activist something, drove to Áras an Uachtaráin, which is where the president lives and has his office, managed to get in there!"
", marched into the office and gave the president a serious giving out to."
The President.
"Obviously Michael D was shocked, but he sat there, listened, and nothing happened to the woman when she was escorted out and allowed to drive home without anything happening."

You leave Michael D.
"alone, you filthy, filthy man!"
I also saw that tweet yesterday.
There’s a dash of Larry David in there.
Larry David playing Danny DeVito as Bernie Sanders.
He's on his way to heckle some Muppets with Statler.
"I advice you not to laugh at leprechauns, they are vindictive."
He’s a national treasure
"#""May I offer you an egg in this trying time?"
Looks like Mr.
"Hooper, or Mr."
Looper if you're Big Bird.
"""Voting is badass!"
Is this the guy that has a pic of him riding a bike or skateboard doing trick
this gave me a nice laugh.
That title is perfect
Nailed it
"I'm not sure what his politics are, but he does indeed look like he wants to make me laugh AND guarantee my family and I healthcare."
Miggledeehiggins!
be careful with that shit.
the Irish absolutely LOVE their president and his majestic dog.
The names err.
Underhill
He is apparently an amazing leader.
And has badass dogs.
Looks like the Tim Burton Penguin made it through rehab and cleaned himself up.
He looks exactly how I think the prime minister of Ireland should look A cross between a wise hobbit and a leprechaun
You leave miggeldyhiggins alone
[deleted]
I suppose that's why Ireland is so significantly less fucked these days.
The US should try it.
Ok just because you yanks have a twat for president doesn't mean you can make fun of others.
This man is well respected and a top scholar.
So piss off
How fuckin dare you.
"I don't care where you're from, but he's litetally the only president I trust, hon the Mick"
Well the American president looks like a tan leather couch trying to look like Boris Johnson
Oswald Cobblepot
21 gigawatts!
Now watch Today FM and other shit Irish pages on Facebook make this joke a million times over the next month
Big words from people who elected a cheese puff
He looks like old Bilbo Baggins.
I'd say Bernie Sanders playing Danny Devito.
Or vice versa.
Looks like Bernie Sanders playing the Penguin
"""I believe the word you're looking for is."
AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!
If Danny Devito and Bernie Sanders had a child.
Its Danny devito playing Bernie Sanders playing bilbo baggins
Danny McDeSanders
This is why I'm proud to be Irish
"before reading the title, i actually thought “Bernie Sanders?"
"Wait, no, Danny DeVito."
He also has his dog on stage sometimes for moral support Ireland is the best
I wish American leaders wore tweed.
I trust a person in tweed.
Miggle D Higgins is awesome.
A true treasure.
"""Be proud to be a decent American, instead of a wanker whipping up fear""Love you Micky D."
It's an honour to have you as our President.
Higginsssss
What about his byrnese(don’t know spelling) dog?
Which is super cute tho.
I'm not even from Ireland but he has my vote.
This man makes me proud to be Irish.
Just look at that suit.
I've never seen a grown man I've wanted to cuddle so much.
Holy shit it does lmao
Or Danny Devito playing Larry David
"I met him years ago, literally as a child."
Got to shake his hand as he congratulated my class on winning a short film competition.
Such a strange memory that's only coming back now
I would rather have him then donlad t
"If I didn’t know who he was, and you showed me a picture of this guy and told me to guess who he was, I would say the leprechaun king of Ireland."
looks like The Penguin's brother
Michael D is an absolute lad
He looks like Furio's uncle from The Sopranos.
As an American I should not make fun of anyone's president.
Glass houses and all.
I love this man
He looks like nice old man that's here to sell you instant oats.
"Aww, he's cute"
No wonder Ireland is heaven
That’s my president.
His real name is Manthis Toboggan
00:34 you can hear him throw up.
(sign of spinal injury)The police wouldn’t let first aid team help him and ordered the boy to get up.
When they found he was unconscious they further tried to drag the boy away from the press and public.
"When they found he was unconscious and had no reaction they eventually let first aid near; first aid crew said they need to cut his clothing to help him but the police refused, and refused to uncuff the boy."
Eventually ambulance was called and the boy is in a critical condition in the hospital now.

"It's obvious what daddy China is doing:Make police become so brutal that protestors **HAVE** to fight back, be it because of outrage or just to survive."

"We need to step in""."

"It is still live as of this post, so you will need to go back and look for events."
The title's background **comes directly from the medic who was working on him** (translated from Cantonese).
Chinese backed thugs demonstrating how vile the Chinese government is
"Biologically speaking, a society that kills the young and only keeps the old has no future."
So it's universal that firefighters are better than cops.
good to know.
Mainland China is now making martyrs of the protesters.
Not good for the Chinese government.
Being evil is so easy for humans.
This is going to only get worse before it gets any better
Firefighters probably cant force police to do anything.
Shamed is likely the real word to describe it.
"Forget area 51, raid Hong kong"
This is why Hong Kong and Taiwan want nothing to do with China.
Fuck this world.
I hope the kid recovers.
Fuck these thugs who call themselves police
The protesters need better tools to fight against tyranny.
A government bent on forceful control of its citizens is a terrible thing that should be overcome.
I hope these people get the government they deserve.
Be strong!
It's sad that people in other countries think that 1st world governments would never trample citizens' rights.
"The more power you give the government, the more they will take."
And by force.
The Chinese government has demonstrated this.
So much for democracy.
These tactics are barbaric and so sad to see.
We as a world need to boycott the Chinese for their actions.
There should be a free and democratic Hong Kong.
"Uh oh, Sounds like someone is going to get in trouble for assaulting someone."
I mean that is what happens when you assault someone.

Insanely brutal.
Let these pictures reach the eyes of the world.
"Not good, fuck this police."
Fuck the Chinese gov't.
Go HK and everyone else fighting for their freedom.
"Xi is a disgusting winnie the pooh bitch, I hope his heart goes on a long journey back into the earth."
Why is authority so evil throughout so much of the world?
The fuck humans?
This brutality has been happening for quite a while now hasn’t it?
Have there been no repercussions to the abusive authorities (and they’re a puppet of China aren’t they?
)It’s undeniable.
"A fact, that this a repulsive abuse of power and an attack on the wellbeing of ordinary citizens."
"Why hasn’t any powerful group stepped in and, quite bluntly, told those in control to go fuck themselves."
"I’ve got no experience of politics yet China is an influential country and punishing them would cause difficulty for everyone, but what’s the point of upholding an ideal of helping humanity in your own country, and ignoring something as poignant as this?"
"In simpler times or situations you could see injustice (as subjective as that is, I believe this counts)  and step in because that’s what you think is the right thing to do."
I believe that any leadership that not just allows but instigates this behaviour should have their power removed as an ethical necessity.
I’m also a lazy young adult who gets frustrated with bad news of bad people while in reality I just want to chill and live comfortably.
Hope people find out the firefighters’ name before he gets disappeared
"stop calling them police and say what they really are, terrorists"
Why aren’t other nations questioning the Chinese government on their treatment to Chinese citizens?
We got into the Korean and Vietnam war because of communism and we lost because majority of the citizens wanted communism.
Now the Chinese want socialism (unions and fair rights) and it doesn’t sound like USA is showing any interest
Fuck China.
What the fuck.
What can we do to stop this?
can we just go over there and fuck shit up?
"I got falsely arrested one time for breaking in my parents house because I didn't have my keys, long story short, they didn't believe me at all, it got physical because I got so much angry, knowing you're right inside you and no one believing you was infuriating."
"Well, they put me down and one dude held his knee on my neck with pressure and it was so painful but I was like ''they're police officers, they know what to do, it's probably safe to do this'' but after seeing this, plz, change that garbage technique and i'm 100% sure this isn't the first injury due to this poor technique."
Fuck the Hong Kong police
I like how that cop in the front in full military gear is pushing someone back.
"Like:  ""GET BACK!"
"WE BEAT HIM UNTIL HE IS PARALYZED, AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF YOU LAY A HAND ON HIS BROKEN BODY"""
Can we start boycotting Chinese goods en mass now?
It honestly seems like HK police have no idea what they're doing.
This is what China will do to the rest of the world if they ever took control.
Once they have power they won’t hesitate to break your fucking neck and deny you aid.
The sooner we stop buying their stolen goods and junk the faster we can prevent these sorts of abuse from happening again
"Hey Hong Kong, a bunch of farmers beat the British Empire, many couldn't read or write."
"You're smart , you can do this!"
Take your freedom.
Some country needs to tell China to stop.
This should not be legal yet it is.
I hope the police who did this are given life in prison.
"THERE WAS NO NEED TO BREAK HIS FUCKING NECK, they could have simply restrained him, but no."
I genuinely hope the sick fuck who did this gets life in prison or death.
"Aswell, there was no need to deny medical attention to someone who clearly needs it."
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly sure denying the ""enemy"" medical attention is a warcrime."
And although these protests may as well be.
"I doubt this is the first or last time something like this has happened, the police have probably killed or seriously injured people before and been able to cover it up, that makes this no less terrible."
"In the following weeks and months we will probably see more and more (again, correct me if I'm wrong) police brutality."
"Whatever the outcome of these protests China will go down as the bad guy of these protests in history, or at least the rest of the world's history books, as we all know about China's censoring."
"Edit: I know I'm just a dumbass 13 year old who posts memes, but that doesn't mean I don't get to have a say in things, after all my generation is going to be running this planet soon if we aren't all atomized or killed by climate change."
"If you support the chinese government, you are a piece of shit"
"Not police in my eyes, animals."
Lock these monsters up in cages and let them rot.
Hong Kong Firefighters sound like they have had enough of the Chinese Government abuse of citizens.
If they formally moved their force to a position of protecting people and property without regard for political pressure then we would see some real progress.
You can’t have this many people dedicated to a cause without everyone being related to someone on this other side.
"(At this point fire fighters, police, business leaders, security forces, Chinese military personnel from Hong Kong all have family in the protests."
)Hong Kong is too tight of a society to have a civil war.
So if this escalated it’s going to be mainland China vs.
Hong Kong.
China seems to have already lost.
Who is orderly and democratic?
Who is abusing citizens and trying to take away rights and freedoms?
The world has decided China is wrong.
"If only they had oil, this shit would have ended weeks ago."
Believe this.
Your government will do this to you.
You must not weaken your Constitutional protections.
"For some reason my parent's generation, the baby boomers from Taiwan spawned from the Chiang Kai Shek fleet, seem to have a lot of support for ""one China."
""" We're separate people from Taiwan, but we are ""Chinese."
""" Yet they continually do not support Chinese actions."
Why the hell do they still insist on calling themselves Chinese and not Taiwanese?
Isn't it more shameful to be associated with this?
Taiwanese politics are chill compared to this.
"As always, the firefighter is more of a hero than the cop."
Few hours from now he’ll become a registered organ donor.
Then a few minutes later he’ll “donate his organs.
” Shortly after that he’ll “succumb to his injuries that were justified in the situation.
” If the Chinese treatment of the Uighur says anything about their methods.

Since the bag is partially collapsed between breaths it states there is not correct flow going to the mask turn to flush.
I wonder how many Chinese dictatorship apologists will be in this thread.
They’ve been more and more frequent lately.
Literally argued with a guy the other day on here that was saying all the protestors were wealthy and that the “landlords were getting scared”.
Nothing worse than a dumb communist lol

The other 3 million who want to protest can't get outside because it's too crowded
Credits to local media.
A little explanation here: Recently a person murdered someone in Taiwan and flew to Hong Kong.
"Hong Kong tried to take the person back to Taiwan for his offense to be charged there, but Taiwan was not in Hong Kong's list of countries that are able to do that."
"Normally Hong Kong will just add Taiwan to the list and get the criminal to Taiwan but the government, which is pro-Chinese, wanted to update the law so that China can now get people in Hong Kong without political reasons too."
"Hong Kongers were terrified and think this will provide the opportunity for China to prosecute people opposing them in Hong Kong, which is a place with freedom of speech, and thought that it was a major threat to them and a break of the 50-year promise ( one country two system) set in 1997."
"Therefore, they went on the streets to speak for the cancellation of the discussion of this new law."
Forgive my limited English.
I saw someone wanting a subreddit dedicated to politics in Asia and I thought it is a good idea so here it is r/AsianPolitics let's see how it goes
"Chinese government: *Wait, that's illegal*"
This is incredible.
Pretty moving seeing that many people rallied over the same thing
"Being one in that million, really glad to know the people (at least some) care about this."
We surely do need more attentions from the other side of Earth.
Why tf is this shit marked NSFW when I cross post it?
:Colonialism is bad nowHong Kong:Don't leave us here with that ass hole!
(points at china)
China doesn't care.
These people are absolutely going to lose their rights because no one on Earth will stand up to the Chinese over human rights.
"Trade yes, human rights no."
"I wouldn't be surprised if there is a massive depopulating of Hong Kong in the next few years, by about 1/7th of its population."
"EDIT: It just occurred to me that what China will probably really do is to replace those people with high ""social standing""."
They've done similar in places like Tibet in the past.
The yellow umbrellas started during the very first protests against the government.
"Fittingly called the ""Umbrella Revolution""."
"Unfortunately, those protests fell flat and the people were just heavily assaulted by corrupt police until they gave up."
It's really crazy to see a protest so large.
I really hope the people of Hong Kong are able to fight back against this.
EDIT: removed 'Yellow' from name of revolution
"That's nice, to bad China don't give a fuck."
I think there were more just couldn’t fit lol
How is this not a massive story?
Hong Kong is one of the most inspiring places in the world.
The people of Hong Kong really care about their freedom and they are well aware of the Chinese Communist Party’s hard work to take their rights away.
My wife is from Shanghai and is watching this non-stop.
"The Chinese people do care, but they have no power to oppose the CCP and the corrupt regime that runs the country."
"Hong Konger here, here's your answers before your questions:>What happened?"
Read OP's top level comment.
Government is pushing an extradition law which basically means China can request Hong Kong to send back people they deem guilty.
Do you trust Chinese laws and court?
>Isn't HK just a part of China?
Yes and no.
"We are part of China, but with the Special Administrative Region status, which *was supposed to* promise ""One country, two systems"", Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and high degree of autonomy until year 2047."
(Keywords: *was supposed to*.
") We have a different government system, education system, and judicial system as well as different language and culture."
"We don't push up property prices of other places to insane levels by mass buying properties, but are the victim of mainland Chinese investors doing so."
"We can access Whatsapp, Facebook, Insta, Reddit etc without VPN."
>Why would the government push such a law that only undermines Hong Kong?
"Unfortunately, In spite of those governmental differences I just described, the HK government is just a sock puppet working for China."
"We can't choose our own Chief Executive, and even our people-elected legislative council members can get kicked out simply because the Chinese government says so - shortly after the last legislative council elections, the Chinese government suddenly ""clarified"" a law that LegCo members need to prove their loyalty to China and kicked out 5 elected members."
"(Our constitutional document, Basic Law, gives the Chinese government supreme authority on clarifying HK laws when needed, but this is the first time such ""clarification"" happened without HK government seeking clarification in the first place, the also the first time this is used aggressively for political purposes."
There will definitely be more to come.
")>That's sad, hope you people together can fight for independence."
Nope.
Not happening.
Extremely unrealistic in both strength and sustainability.
Personally I don't see any kind of hope here and hoping for a chance for emigration so I can gtfo of this cursed place asap.
>Did you join the demonstration?
>Tanks lol xdddddNope.
Not funny.
As I said before Hong Kong is not fully the same as China.
"It's nearly 4 AM now, I need to sleep."
"Funny how the only major british colony that wasn't a disaster was given to the shittiest government on earth, the rest got independence."
That first pic shows the scale better on how big this is getting

How do they know how many people are protesting to the nearest thousand?
"And look how civilized they are about it, even staying out of traffic"
"The fact that the front page of my country's most visited news site is about illegal air balloons ffs and no mention of this at all, says a lot."
Tankies give the left a bad name.

org/wiki/State_capitalism?
[The government has started censoring even more Western media outlets.
If the course isn’t corrected the US is headed down the same path.
Love Hong Kong.
Most organized and respectful protests I've ever seen.
Says a lot about the quality of people there.
[removed]
"I am glad they are protesting, but worried China will smash them down."
I’m betting that China takes control of Hong Kong long before 2047.
They already have massive influence.
"While a million of protestors came out to protest against the extradition law, the HK government simply ignored all of the citizens and decided to go on as if all of the protestors misunderstood the law."
Can you imagine a government worse than that?
Though I'm not physically there it's a proud day to be a Hong Konger.
Should have stayed British I miss Hong Kong as part of the British empire
Goddamn!
So inspiring!
03 million is pretty specific.
how they estimate this stuff?
"Great to see so many ppl out though, hope it helps 😬"
"The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: 六四事件, liùsì shìjiàn), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989."
"More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn)."
The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law.
"In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square."
"The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000."
Standing strong and standing together.
Freedom is worth fighting for.
Amazing.
I have chills.
I hope they succeed
China is so over powered its scary
"Take note, Americans."
Holy fuck
I know I’m in hk
1/7 people in hk is a millionaire
"In Chinese news today, 1."
03 million people mysteriously disappeared.
Awesome!
Fuck Xingping and his posse of haters.
r/theydidthemath
"An unusually orderly protest as well, kudos to them for keeping 1/2 the road clear"
“Rights”
"With a response like this, it's not hard to understand why the Chinese are shitting their pants about Tienanmen Square images making the rounds."
"Good luck, be safe."
Good.
Liberty is being attacked on all fronts.
Please defend your human rights.
Life looks so cellular from above.
I’m pretty sure one of those guys is just trying to get to MickyD’s for dinner.
China doesn't do too well with protests.
Last time there was a protest on June 4th [REDACTED AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT]
That’s my freaking people.
"One country, two **very different** systems"
This is just a test for their new point system.
I see it as 1/7 people can no longer travel.
And whatever other bullshit that score doesn’t allow you to do.
"Reminder that China has 800,000 to 1,000,000 Muslims in concentration camps"
Its time for the Chinese to overthrow thier government and become a real democracy.
I prey it is done swiftly and with little bloodshed.
"Currently, the protest is over."
The government did absolutely nothing about it.
Not even a proper response.
The bill is still scheduled to be passed on the 12th.
People are organizing a second protest on the 11th but I'm worried it won't be any more effective than the first one.
Thank you for choosing One Party Socialist Republic.
We know you have many choices in government and it looks like you chose the wrong one.
Fuck yeah

So was he one of the pigs in G Force?
one of my guinea pigs was really smart when I was a kid.
He was allowed to run free in the yard when my family was outside.
Every single night at 5:15 pm he would stand infront if his cage and waited to go inside.
his inner clock was amazing.
also he would squeak when he heard noises from plastic because he thought it’s feeding time.
"he died when he was like 10 because he has a tumor, poor little thing."
He was my favorite one of all of the ones I had.

I'm still laughing minutes later.
It looks so damn strange.
It's such a diverse audience.
So many possible stories to this.
Suit dude in the front must be an important person.
"He knows that whatever it is you are doing there is going to be awesome, he couldn't be more proud."
Suit dude No 2 in the back is either his boss monitoring or he wants to get you for his company.
Gangstaboy in the back there seems a bit out of place.
Is he here for your whatever or is he up to something?
A few people are kind of distracted.
but that's okay they are happy.
"Lady in green is propably your biggest fan and maybe you should watch your back, just in case."
I love this.
Quirkily wonderful.
And perspective is perfect.

Good work!

That's the crowd for any 2000 era sport game.

You have a lot of good looking friends.
Hmmmmm
Quality post
What kinda art project has a miniature audience?
Looks like you're a hit the ladies.

They really want you bro.

My grandpa lived with my family growing up and he had alzheimers.
I'd be playing NBA Live and he'd watch and comment thinking it was an actual basketball game on TV lol.
"My grandpa does that too, I love it \^\^Now whenever I see him working on his Truck, I ask him the same :)"
"Playing minecraft, still telling him yes"
Mine passed I loved him
"""I am now, thank you."
"You know, as a Millennial with Gen z kids, I really enjoy how we can relate to their games."
"That when my kid plays Apex, I understand that game and can ask about his favorite characters, guns, about his exploits in the game."
My youngest is a Zelda nut and loves the SNES one so that one is real easy to relate to.
My dad never really played a video game in his life.
He had no idea what the hell I was doing on that machine.
"My dad be like: ""better buy drugs than video games."
Alright this is gonna get lost but who cares it’s a wholesome storySo my dad had his own version of this.
"He passed away right at the end of 2018, and I’ve been thinking about him, and this reminded me of something."
I lived games.
"He had bought me, at that point, all the games I had wanted, all Nintendo games."
"He would try to play with me sometimes, and he never won (except on this n64 racing game - he was good at that one) but he would play with me."
I could go on.
"Anyways, he got into the habit of saying stuff like “oh, well, I’m winning and you just don’t see it,” and “no, see, I’m setting up the super thing and I’m gonna win the whole thing” when there wasn’t a super thing, and this went on and on."
"Eventually it boiled down to him looking into the room, watching me play for a moment, and then saying “am I winning?"
I think I’m winning.
” Made me smile every time.
I miss you dad.
"Not my grandpa, but my grandma!"
I even showed her how to play Nintendogs!
You had me in the first half.
not going to lie
Haha.
My dad used to do this when I was little.
He’d ask it like he thought I was winning a match in a fighting game or something.
"Usually, I’d be playing Spyro or something."
"It’s kind of hard to define “winning” with a game like that, so I’d just say, “Well, I’m not dying, anyway."
Are ya winning son?
I work at a retirement home as a server in their bistro and the residents know I love video games.
A few ask if I’m still “watching those video games” with a friendly smile and it just warms my heart.
I’ve been working there for a year now.
I say either this or “have you been declared king of the nerds yet?
"” when my boyfriend plays Magic online, for similar reasons."
I don’t know or care about MtG but I love him so I’m happy when he’s doing well/happy.
So wholesome 😭
"\*Looks at Minecraft house I'm building\*""Yup!"
"Man, my grandpa and I used to play every new Zelda release after school."
"He was so into it, and my grandma would hand-draw world maps for us and mark down collectibles and dungeons."
"Really fucking killed me when Alzheimer’s turned him into a shell of who he used to be but I always remember him as the badass grandpa that helped me 100% OOT, Majora’s Mask and Twilight Princess."
God dammit the memories are flooding back.
good old days.
He used to ask that every time when I was playing on my laptop .
I used to be semi annoyed at that time but now I missed that voice so much :(
My grandfather has been watching my cousin and I play FIFA for years.
"When we first started as kids, Brazil was all the shit and Kaka (Brazilian player) really stuck with him for some reason."
"15 years later, we’ll still play it occasionally over his place and he’ll say “is Kaka playing?"
” “Where’s Kaka?
"Kaka has been retired for years at this point, but it’s still hilarious every time."
"He’s 82 now, and make it a point to visit him and my grandmother as often as I can."
"Me, playing stardew valley, married, have two kids, just taking care of my crops and animals: ""Yup""I wish I had a grandpa present in my life."
"My grandfather is Asian, so instead of “winning” it’s “studying”"
My parents do this
My grandpa did this.
I miss him every day :(
Lol I feel like this is me to my bf
Not my grandparents but my mom.
When I was little she used to do laundry and watch me play video games.
"She was sad when I finished zelda ocarina of time, she said she liked watching that boy run around the fields."
Now that I have kids I watch them play video games and ask whos winning?
They usually rope me into playing with them.
I miss my grandpa.
He used to be in the military and he loved watching me play Cod.
He always had a cool story for the gun I was using or stories from his deployment.
Bravo
Extremely wholesome
"Shit, I miss gramps."
I haven’t had any grandpas since I was born so I wouldn’t under stand
"Glad for you, mine just rants about the classic bullcrap stereotypes about videogames and I have to drive him outside my home because he is just unbearable."
Me: *plays game*My dad who doesn’t know anything about games; So you have chosen death.
My grandfather visited us once when I was 4.
He noticed I was watching Thomas the Tank Engine and told me how his dad used to be a locomotive engineer (and taught me to pronounce the word engineer).
"Since then, I'd wanted to be some sort of engineer."
Today I am.
had a stroke yesterday.
"still fighting, chances are low."
really low.
why did I open this 😭
"When I finally got a console, my gramps did a lot of research and always got the coolest new video game he suspected I wanted for me (usually call of duty) for Christmas and birthdays, even though he never played them."
He never half-assed anything and always involved himself in people’s lives even if he was a little out of his element.
Miss him a lot.
One of my grandfathers died when my father was 11 and the other I was never allowed to meet because he was an abusive piece of shit who died shortly after I was born.
"But the first grandfather, as I’ve been told, was the nicest, most caring man alive, and a genius, well respected surgeon to boot."
"Sometimes I get sad that I never got to have experiences like this, but then I remember how incredible the wives they left behind are."
"One of my grandmothers was always at my house when I was little, or I was always at hers."
"She walked me around our little town and everyone knew her, by extension everyone met me."
"She now has very bad dementia, and has forgotten all of her five children at some point, but remembers them the next day."
"But she hasn’t forgotten me, she still remembers me as the little 5 year old boy who got to visit her everyday and now she always says, “You’ve gotten so big!"
” Whenever I get to see her.
My other grandmother is the one of the most talkative and kind women I’ve ever met.
"She had a stroke recently, but she’s fine now and lives in an in-law we made out of our garage."
"I’m sad I didn’t get to know my grandfathers, but my grandmothers filled the gap pretty damn well."
"*woah there, that's too wholesome for me*"
"My Grampa used to do this when I'd be playing something like just cause and I'd be like ""uh."
"yeah"""
I was playing far cry 3 and I prefer to use bows in that game because Skyrim has taught me to be a stealth archer in every game.
Anyways.
My dad who I haven’t connected with a whole lot was asking me questions about what type of bow it was and trying to relate to me.
It’s was really cool that he did that.
I still don’t have a great relationship with him but it’s getting better.
I think about that moment a lot tbh.
"my granpda says ""are you losing?"
This hits WAYYYY to close to home
Mine said this once when i was in the loading screen
I wish I had a grandpa that would do that.
I miss him so much
This is literally my wife when I'm playing any game
"My grandpa came up to my room to see if i was reary to head to the football (soccer) game, saw me planting crops in a solo minecraft world and asked ""ya winnin wee man?"
""" And it was by far the most wholesome thing I've experienced in a while."
*intentionally feeding mid and flaming teammates*“Yup.
I was born too late to meet both of my grandpas.
"“With you, Grandpa, I’m always winning."
"I actually played Minecraft with my grandma once, it was great"
I do this when my cousin plays Minecraft servers
That's my grandma to me
"My dad would see my frustration while playing NCAA Football '06 and say, ""Are your guys not blocking again?"
"""with you papa, i am"""
And it's appreciated god damnit!
This is my dad
My parents don’t love me but I’m just happy that you’re loved.
Nice meme.
I wish some of my family took any interest lol
"Same with my dad, except he tells me to kill or beat everyone up."
Grandads that do this are the best
My grandfather would say that all the time and I would just roll my eyes and he'd laugh.
I miss him.
2 real
Thank you for this - it was EXACTLY my thought when I saw the nasty post yesterday.
It is akin to folks seeing me reading on my Kindle and ask what I'm reading: a polite opener for conversation.
"are ya winning, kids?"
aye aye captainI can't hear ya!
AYE AYE CAPTAIN
It is he who is in fact winning!
My dad does this all the time and it just makes me happy
I wish I still had my grandpa-sorry if it's making anyone sad I just miss him
"Me, getting erased by recluse for the 1000000th time: Yeah, Grandpa, I’m doing just fine."
Had me in the first half
"Not my grandpa but a cool thing my mom did recently was come into my room to talk but when she saw me playing a game, she asked a couple questions about the game and just watched me play."
"It was a little hard with an ""audience"" watching but it was awesome that she took the time to try and understand my interests"
My granddaddy would coach me when I was playing Madden and tell me to run certain plays.
I got the Cowboys to the Super Bowl in Madden 98 doing that with him.
"From stories like these I wish I knew my grandpas, from all the stories they seem like such interesting people"
Me playing Stardew Valley wanting to see him smile: yes I’m winning
My dad does this.
"I always say yes, even in a game like Minecraft or Stardew Valley."
Yes I am grandpa*Continues playing animal crossing*
God bless you all my brothers and sisters.
I used to play CoD4 on PC with a 70 year old guy.
He was pretty good too.
He died a few years back.
Online name was Hondo
You sound like a winner.
My dad would always say that while i was playing my games.
Also “what’s your score?
Psh grandpa first introduced us to video games.
Used to play pinball on his old pc everyday.
Taught me how to play solitaire.
While we watched M.
H in the afternoons before supper.
Are ya ready kids?
"Yes grandfather, now watch me 360  no scope my enemies and yeet on them     Back in my day we would yeet when we meet our loved ones"
"My mom that doesn't know anything about DnD but saw I was having fun with my friends:""So who won?"
Awwwwww.
wholesome
Wholesome hour.
Oh man this just brought memories flooding back of my grandma and I (my grandma is  actually the person who got me into video games first) playing donkey Kong country on the SNES and my grandpa walking into the room and saying exactly this lol
"This is a great post, thank you!"
My boyfriend does this lol.
My grandpa spent hours practicing Guitar Hero when it first came out so he could jam with me every time we saw each other.
"He could never get past medium, but we loved playing together."
Great memories.
Mines got Alzheimer's disease and he asks me this every 5 mins.
god bless him.
I like this my garndpa still has a wii and i decided to use it and when i was done playing bowling he went to play it and just outright kicked my ass in the game fun times.
And a more recent one i was playing fnaf and he even tried to help me look for chica but ultimately failed and i just saw the smile on face.
Love you grandpa
Damn this whole thread is really making me miss my grandpa.
"He minded his own business most of the time and was a very quiet man (he mainly stayed in his painting room) so I don't really have any videogame-related memories of him, but reading all of these made me smile."
This accurate for so many people in my family.
I miss my grandpa.
Wait.
Elders supporting us.
I never thought I'd see it
"I am a grandfather, and I do this."
Friendly remember to love your grandparents a lot.
"–With love, someone whose grandpa passed away"
Are they all dead yet?
"My dad: “wow, nice graphics these days”Been saying it since 2005"
Guys I’m winning Minecraft
"My grandpa calls me ""Louie caplouie"" (?"
") and ""Mr."
"Shoot 'em up""."
I love him.
My grandpa is a boomer who thinks video games are the reasons for mass shootings.
FeelsBadMan
Happy early cake day
"Everytime my dad walks in and I'm playing a game he goes ""ooh, lemme show you how to get past this level"""
This is the same for me except my little siblings
"My dad does the same except he always says, “what level are you on?"
Ill never forget playinf half life 2 ans my grandpa comes into the room to watch me.
"He catches sight of a radio in game and tells me ""put a bullet in it"""
good grandparents are a gift to mankind.
"*hehe I am playing Minecraft, foolish boomer*"
Aye aye captain

“Where’s my guy” - my friends elderly dad playing halo ce
This is my dad when I play Minecraft lol
plot twist: you were actually on pornhub
I grew up with mine (still going healthy & strong at 94!

Everyone’s dad*
This so desperately needed the rebranding.
I love it now

"Old people also like to ask ""have they found eachother yet?"
""" when you're reading a book, I mean I'm reading a WH40k pulp novel about an Inquisitor chasing a Heretic, and he hadn't found him yet, so it was still appropriate."
I remember playing call of duty (finest hour)  when I was younger any he would always try to figure out where I was since he’s a history guy.
It was really fun
"My Heart, it hurts, for the love he gives."

I wish I had a grandfather like that
My mom did this when my brother and I were playing.
Miss my mom now.
I loved when I played forza horizon 4 with my grandpa it was fun
My grandpa encouraged me to play Fortnite to win him some money after seeing that Kyle guy win 3 mil
Why am i reading that in a pirate kind of way.
This never fails to make me tear up
I wish i visited my grandparents enough to relate to this meme
Grandparents irl
I don’t have a grandpa
"Mine passed long ago and my grandma doesnt even knows what are video games so yeh :,("
"Man this hit home alright, the nostalgia is sweeping over me."
p Ted.
Thanks for trying.
That's absolutely what my grandad used to say!
"My dad just says ""You're gonna lose anyway"""
"My grandpa is not present 99% times I'm playing my PS3, my dad, on the other hand, introduced me to Gran Turismo, Virtua Fighter, Little Big Planet and a whole lot of other titles, always plays with me if the possibility is present."
Why did I read that in a American way?
"My grandpa saw me playing Team Fortress 2 once and when he saw the Heavy's minigun he said ""Keee'yaaaww that's a money spender yeah!"
"""(he was VERY Cajun)"
"Me, getting my ass handed to me on a gold platter: ""yeah"""
I lightweight teared up for this one.
"I can’t wait to be a father, because when I do, my kids will be playing halo, and I’ll tell them stories of the legendary year of 2007 where we all pwned noobs :)"
Replace grandpa with 65 year old dad and I can relate
"Who else read ""are ya winning"" in the pirates voice from the SpongeBob intro?"
I have the best memories of playing Donkey King with my grandma on their Super Nintendo when I was little!
wth that's what my father in law asks me.
I thought it was just a quirk of his.
That’s awesome lol
Honorable mention to my mom who does the exact same thing.
"My grandpa when I was playing COD as a kid: ""You're really poppin' them Japs left and right!"
Bro my dad does this
"""Hey enemy look look shoot him right there look""""Dad that's my teammate"""
"I used to play WoW all the time, my dad would always ask ""So have you beat the game yet?"
That’s my *dad*
That’s my dad right there
How I feel about people asking that with dnd.
"No idea why but I read ""are ya winning?"
""" in the voice of the captain from the spongebob squarepants theme song"
my grandpa will watch anything you put in front of him.
"I’ll watch yeet smash or recently, evo matches and react when he sees someone get punished or killed even though he knows nothing else going on."
while my parents would probably criticize the shit out of it.
#gamingboomers
My dad did this when we lived at home.
He also got really into the final fight with Ganon in Twilight Princess and was shouting out what direction he went and stuff.
"Years ago, when my grandpa was still alive, I was playing Pokemon Pinball."
He saw me playing and asked about it and seemed interested.
"I'm not sure if he had ever played a game before, but I gave him my game boy to try."
"He pushed a couple buttons and the ball just fell, but I will always remember how excited he was watching it and his laugh that followed."
In those brief moments I think he really did enjoy himself.
My grandpa did this to me once while I was playing sims.
I explained the whole concept of sims and that it’s a simulated world and how you don’t necessarily “win”.
10 minutes later he asked me if I was winning.
Gotta love him.
Lol my grandpa hates me and says I have no future this is inaccurate bull shit
Aye aye Grandpa!
I love it when he does that :D
Wholesome :)
"Me: \*playing Minecraft\* I'm winning now, now that you're here, Gramps!"
"Yes, I'm whining!"
My grandma used to ask me this when i was a kid.
She passed away in 2001.
I miss her a lot sometimes.
This is me telling every person on the cosplay subreddit that they look great while having absolutely no idea what character they are portraying
My dad used to say this.
except he was being sarcastic and believed all of them were a waste of time.
We didn't have a great relationship.
My granddad died a long time ago but I can still hear this sentence in his voice.
Thanks OP
Me: gets killed in an online shooter.
My Dad: oh ffs
My grandkids have to fight me for the controller.
"""Yeah, yeah I'll give you a turn at minecraft in a bit, gotta finish leveling up here."
Me to my boyfriend ♡ lol
*playing Minecraft* kinda?
Also applies to clueless wives and husbands !
So cute of you 💙💙💙
Hell yea grandpa.
"My great uncle always asked, I'd answer him truthfully."
He passed away not too long ago
"To know if you’re winning is to know if you’re losing, to lose it to not obtain the prize but the prize is the journey rather than the destination, i think the questions answer is in itself."
When my dad comes downstairs he watches me play siege.
He watches me and saysJesus you move too fast for me!
Sometimes when I die he will legit sayGood try adam.
Other times if i get a kill he will clap It's kind of fun
Damn wish I had a grandpa.
America does not tolerate a loser!
That's why America has never and will never lose a war!
Basically you can win something in every game
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
I thought not.
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.
It's a Sith legend.
"Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying."
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
"He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did."
"Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep."
"Damn, I miss my grandma."
She died 6 years ago just 2 days after my birthday and I wish I gave more effort in spending time with her.
To which you respond: “I’m spending time with you so absolutely I’m winning!
My grandpa used to do that to me :\\\ cherish all the time you have with your grandparents everyone.
"I used to get livid when my mom would say this, so now of course my wife does it just to irritate me."
"Which, of course, means we must continue the tradition with my son."
who hates it.
It was always “you kicking his butt?
” for me.
Grandpa is also a very violent man.
/s if anyone can’t tell.
*Me Delivering cargo in Euro Truck Sim 2*My Mom: Are you winning?

I read this like Patchy the Pirate from spongebob.
- “ARE YA’ WINNIN KIDS?
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH”
Growing up my dad called every gaming thing an Nintendo
My granpa passed away a year ago.
"I didn't miss him that much, but this post hit me right in the feels"
"Idk why, but i love when people do this."
Just to care enough about a person to say this even of they don't understand it at all.
It makes a difference
I remember I had a lightgun with my original PlayStation with Time Crisis and my grandma had a go on that and was shooting all these bad guys.
I wish camera phones existed in those days.
"Mine says, are you winning?"
Because if not I will win them

Let’s say it last a total of 4 hours before mod’s lock it for being a shitpost.
At 39.
"99 or a lowly 84,538."
86 dollars.
American.
BUT WAIT.
"Target is having a buy 2 get one free deal so he can save the cost of 704 copies  of the game which is a cool 28,152."
96 dollars saved  not bad.
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING IS THERE A BETTER DEAL FUCK YEAR THERE IS.
HE can order the 2 left over copies from amazon and get 20% off each one (if he is a prime member and he buys one of each through amazon dropping the price to a 31.
99 each or 63.
98) OR HE COULD JUST BUY 2 more from target and get a free copy for himself.
So if he does the great Amazon deal he would be out roughly $56449.
88 (more with taxes but I don’t know where he is hopefully a state tax free one though.
")If he does the target only route he is out $56,465."
88 but will have an extra copy.

"Hi rich and bored, I'm dad."
Shaq always looks like he is living his best life.
I love how you both just went for it!
"He looks equally as excited to meet you, which is amazing!"
"That little ""yes!"
So are you one of those guys in the background of news broadcasts working on your computer?
Are those people actually working or are they there just for show?
It was the greatest hug I’ve ever received (and ever will).
This is so cute!
I bet that made your fucking year.
"You are just some random person and you got a great, sincere hug from Shaq."
"Watching this, I can't help but feel that I, also a random person, would deserve a hug too."
"In a way, Shaq just hugged us all."
"So much room for awkwardness with this type of embrace: you jump a bit longer than the other hugger, the pull away is unnatural, you accidental step on their toe, etc."
Huge room for error.
But this.
this is the smoothest impromptu jump hug I've ever seen.
And I've seen at least six.
probably seven.
I have a theory called “The Shaq Theory” It basically means Shaq can go anywhere he wants within the USA.
"If he buys a ticket to a basketball game, he can just walk right on to the court."
If he’s at McDonald’s he can just walk to the back and start making fries.
If he’s at an elementary school he can just start teaching the class.
There are very few places Shaq needs permission to be.
If he goes to a concert he can just walk up to the stage.
Hell if he wanted to walk in my house and take a nap who the fuck is stoping him?
I love Shaq.
"Are you like 6'5""?"
imgur.
gif) and going right in for the dap.
You performed when the pressure was on.
TIL how id react if Shaq wanted a hug lol
I love Shaq because he never tries to be anyone other than Shaq.
Dude I saw this live!
Thought it was hilarious!
Your dap game is impeccable
"I don’t know who added the “OP Is 6’4” tag but thank you, mysterious mod, for my inbox has been flooding with “how tall are you?"
"”Also, because a number of people have asked, I’m a reporter for CNBC."
com (I write about Markets and Space news).
My dream is to get a hug from Shaq.
"I am 6'8"" and he is probably one of the only people who could make me feel small."
Also like other people said how tall are you?
"I saw Shaq as a special guest DJ last year at a festival and he was having the time of his life, love that guy!"
Shaq is amazing.
"I remember riding my motorcycle years ago back when he played for the Phoenix Suns, he came up on me, smiled and waved and we rode for several miles."
I met Shaq about 6-7 days ago.
I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done.
"So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in but Shaq himself."
"I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he played NBA 2k19 on his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him."
"Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Shaq, but she wouldn't stop."
Pretty soon he gets up and walks over.
He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong.
I replied that she was probably hungry or something.
"So Shaq put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt."
He breast fed her right there in the middle of the hair salon.
"Chill guy, really nice about it."
You look like you just had the best day at work anyone has ever had in history.
Shaq is awesome.
I watched this over & over & can conform that he went in for the hug *&* the hop first.
This is so cute.
I'd feel good for the rest of my life if this happened to me.
Great hug but that was a pretty solid five as well
That looked very natural.
Well done.
Holy fuck OP is spiderman
The craziest thing here is OP is actually 7 feet tall himself
LOL wow that was cute
Dude!
I first saw you on your Everton honeymoon post.
I was looking through your account and was like “waittttt.
Dude how tall are you?
"Dude you must be like 6'10"""
I thought they were in bestbuy
Great hug just great!
What did it feel like knowing that he could have absolutely squeezed you to death if he wanted to?
The fact that you actually came up to Shaq's shoulder must mean you're actually a pretty tall person.
Everybody who gets to bounce with Shaq is living a better life than me.
Are you pregnant now?
"Being “hugged by Shaq” is one of the rare things that can be either super wholesome, or kill you."
I mean.
I’d def have hugged you too.
r/ShaqHoldingThings
Isn't that the guy from the Icy Hot and The General ads?
That was more than a hug!
That was life changing!
"This made me giggle lol, that will be the biggest man you will ever hug"
"Lol that's pretty awesome, was fun watching his interview on CNBC today, cool dude that seriously knows his stuff"
"Man, you look so happy as I would be!"
In that moment you were undoubtedly the coolest person in the world
"Just out of interest, how tall are you OP, Shaq doesn't like much taller than you?"
Shaq is amazing.
The people of Orlando love him and meeting him in radon places.
He is the most down to earth gentle giant you could ever hope to come across.
yoo i saw this happen.
Solid handshake as well
I watched his interview on CNBC but missed your hug.
How cool for you.
That is a genuine damn hug!
You are a big dude.
Bro handshake game on point
"Bro, the fact you even completed that handshake is godlike, and the hug to top it off."
Glourious.
"i can hear the pristine SLAP of that handshake, well done"
There’s another post on the front page right now where people are getting upvoted like crazy for congratulating Jerry Seinfeld for awkwardly rejecting a hug from another celebrity.
"Make up your damn minds, people."
"Hey, you're the space reporter!"
"Nice work, mate!"
Haha I was watching this live and thought “they must have met at some point”.
So dope that was you!
You were dick to belly button with SHAQUILLE O'NEAL
Just casually getting back to my fucking amazing 5-monitor work battlestation after being hugged by Shaq on live TV.
"&#x200B;What a day man, good for you!"
You are a big fucking dude
I watch CNBC everyday and love when Shaq shows up.
100% living that best life!
damn dude your tall
Others have said it but I have to chime in: there was so much room for error in so many places in that hug and yet both of you nailed every part of it.
It really was a ballet of bromance.
Top work.
so you work at CNBC?
Watched the segment.
was informative
Love the “thanks mate” type pat on the back and then he embraces you.
and then you embrace back and it’s taken to the next step.
Possible outcome: bro zoned.
What a boss!
"Happy for you, thats a really cool moment."
"Well, you win today /u/thesheetztweetz!"
Yo OP must be a huge dude.
He actually looks normal next to Shaq.
"Damn, you must actually be pretty tall"
"man you must be tall af, he dosent look like the giant he is"
You are almost as tall as Shaq?
Dude shaq hugs best hugs
Bro you’re tall as fuck
r/tippytaps
We all have that one friend
Even I felt the excitement in that hug
You’re kinda tall man
What was it like being hugged by somebody who could easily rape you

Did you know that Bart is actually voiced by a female voice actor
"So I guess I can just photoshop Peter Griffin giving to charities, Bender adopting homeless dogs and Cartman saving lives for up votes now can I?"
My favorite part is that he knows it’s bart
I can't tell who's taking from who anymore.
This was frontpage on iFunny today.
This made my day.
Love how Moe acknowledges Bart by name this time around.
"It wasn't but a week ago I saw something similar on 9gag (i know ) that turned into a ""it'll get better reader"" type of thing."
I really needed that at that moment because I was feeling pretty down about not being able to pay my rent this month and what I'll end up doing afterwards.
"Come today I get a call about being apart of this study I signed up for a couple months back, it's a few days after I'm supposed to pay my rent, but I'm hopeful my landlord will let me wait a few days."
The study is supposed to pay me $400 and that'll be just enough to tide me over on rent this next month until I can hopefully find a job.
Here's hoping it's legit though
**Rare footage of Bart actually being kind****Circa 2019**
Not today old friend
"This is the third ever post that Has Reached 110k, that I’ve seen"
Eat pant
And I thought I finally figured out the secret of Bart (rude).
"Awww, so wholesome."
"I also liked the one where Bart tries to prank Moe with ""I'm looking for a Mr."
"Hugh Jass"", and it turns out there was a guy named that in the tavern."
"Bart awkwardly states it was just a prank and that he'd like to hang up, and Mr."
Jass obliges good naturedly.
This is so good that it’s almost like it’s real
Wholesome prank call.
"Here I am, with I."
as my inatials.
still the loneliest man in the world.

Moe is one of my favorite characters.
"Always supporting Homer even though he's in love with ""Milch"", even helped Homer to save his own marriage from falling apart instead of betraying him, and also he's relatable af."

Wonder if Homer set him up to this sceme?

This is so cute!

This was also during the Dachshund races right from Sunday right?
My friend invited me but we had a birthday party to go to for my daughter.
I wish I would have gone solely for this.
I love my state.
How did they get enough people to volunteer to do this?
Make it so
This is the best thing I have ever seen
Needs fences for jumping.
Plot twist those are hourses in dinosaur costumes
So unfunny i nearly killed myself
The running shoes look super modern but the outfit looks prehistoric.
I now know what my birthday wish is.
Thank you.
"They should just make a completely new olympics with silly, yet entertaining, sports like this."
"I remember a japanese sport where the mission is to bring down a pole, that would also fit perfectly in the silly olympics."
Put a jockey on it and you have my support.
Emerald Downs also does camel (single hump) and ostrich racing.
I went a few years back nearly everyone fell off.
It was hilarious.

If one falls and breaks their leg are they taken to the oil factory?
This is what I imagine The Great Dying looked like moments before meteor impact
"I don't watch horse racing (it's boring), but I would watch the hell out of this."
"Auburn, WA"
Or what about the two person horse costumes?
"There are no raptors left alive in the wild, and only a few hundred left in captivity."
I just watched one of them collapese and die of a heart attack.
When will we stop supporting this barbaric sport?
Yes please
I wanna see Olympic events like this.
"This is one of the greatest feats humanity has made, above any green mandate or use of solar power."
"Man, “Seabiscuit” looks a lot different from what I remembered."
I’d start gambling if this was a thing the local track did.
We need obstacle courses added to this.
like MXC
youtube.
this is obviously hilarious.
American entertainment at its' best.
"One day, long after the humanity has ended, another culture will discover evidence of this."
They will be confused.
"Welp, I can go to sleep happy tonight, knowing that I have seen the best the internet has to offer for the day."

It would be cruel to put horses in these costumes.
Jesus this is what I’ve been missing.
I knew it was something.
And this is that something.
"It's actually fitting since horse racing is called the ""sport of kings""."
i was fucking dying laughing at that dude that fell
Slip Diskit
So someone finally found a way to capitalise on my T-Rex fetish.
At first glance I thought this was a meerkat race.
kind of disappointed.
Edit: spelling
Where do I sign
I’m calling shenanigans.
Looks like there are more T-Rexs than starting gates.
The dino-racers at the front of the gate had an enormous head-start on the ones behind them.
"Look, I’m all for making this an Olympic Sport but there must be _rules_ goddammit."
DYING!
DEAD!
DECAYED!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Could not more strongly agree.
This would be incredibly easy to rig but I will literally bet my house on this race
Hell yeah
"My mom took me on a surprise spring break trip to Kentucky to see some horses, i am not a fan of horses at all."
This is way more entertaining
Emerald Downs?
Nice!
Irl t-rex’ be getting royalty checks all day
This looks like a modern version of MXC
Emerald Downs?
Holy shit.
How did I not know about this.
where do i sign up?
They run like freaking Titans
The Jeep chase scene hasn't held up so well.
Soooo funny!
I would pay money to see this instead of horse races!
That poor t-Rex that tripped in the beginning 😂
My heart goes out to the one and only T-Rex that fell in this race.
Every person involved in this race will be paid off or killed because there is too much money in horse racing.
If you like this you all should check out Marblelympics
"Imagine getting asked out on a first date and this is where they take you, would marry them straight away"

THAT WAS AT EMERALD DOWNS?
Hey that's my local race track!
"They have so many good events, and free Fridays in the summer if you do on a certain day to pic up a T-shirt!"
I was at this race Saturday and it was actually pretty funny afterwards.
A few of the T-Rexs collapsed winded and the one who won the race was running so fast you could see his face pressing through the costume in person.
It reminded me slightly of that scene in Alien.
&#x200B;All the kids loved it.
Lmao!
Yeeees!
"I mean we laugh, and it is funny, but I bet these falls they take hurt af!"

the one that falls got me dead
Since dinosaurs are already dead there would be no issue.
DINOSAUR RACING
"But if you break your leg during the race, we’re going to have to shoot you in the face."
They DO move in herds!
Just need to have a baby in jockey gear riding their backs for true authenticity.
That's hilarious!
"They should consider dressing the winner as a Jurassic Park Character and giving him a 1"" head start in the next race"
Where.
Sound?
Why isn't there competitive human racing with betting?
We bet on other sports.
Such a better idea
"Lol, if gambling on races took more the form of MXC I would probably be interested in it."
I will absolutely sign that petition
"Absolutely, where the hell do I sign."
The definition of REEEEEEEEEEEEE
I smell mr.
beast on on those costumes
Where I should sign?
Make them all sumo wrestler sized dudes and I'm all for it.
When they get skinny they should be forced to retire
I would 20 bucks to see it as thats all i have
I was like someone is gonna fall.
yep there it is.
"Unfortunately, 4 of those T-Rexes had to be euthanized after the race."
Where the hell do I sign this petition?
Rip to that one Dino that fell and had to be shot
It should be a full contact sport.
I thought its a Chinese game show.
hahaha
I have many questions
This is gold.
I used to work for the company that does this!
They're a local pest control company called Triguard that works around Seattle.
My T-Rex costume deflated right before we started running last year.
'twas a shame.
Greatest idea on earth.
"Jurassic Cup, here we come!"
this is how the DNC should weed out the weak - only the 10 fastest to move on to the next round of presidential debates.

I would pay to watch this live lol
This made me happy.
Never knew I wanted this until now
Petition to change everything to this
Where do I sign?
Looks like the democrat 2020 race
Man this was like 5 miles from my house and I fucking missed it.
Fuckin’ majestic
Severe lack of falling.
I'm very disappointed.
I would go to this
These flopping back heads totally remind me of the Titan on Attack on Titan that runs arms flailing and head flopped back

You could even call it the Prehistoric Games!
This could totally work.
"The pool of runners would have to be anonymous, and the gamblers could still place their wagers."
"Maybe before the race, the runners in their T-rex garb could prance around or whatever for half an hour to allow the gamblers to make an assessment of who they want to bet on."
"They could even have bets on who they think are going to fall down, possibilities are endless."

Could someone make this happen ?
It would be fun to run in front of them and let it feel like they were chasing you

Are they roaring?
I hear roaring in my head.
"I would pay to attend, bet gratuitously and even dress up for this."
Truly a pinnacle of human evolution
Goddamn those dinosaur costumes are funny in every situation.
This is rich people watching poor people make fools of themselves for their pleasure.
that dog's singing really speaks to my soul
What a cartoonishly wonderful scene.
That family must be so happy.
The way his tail and her butt wags even harder each time he hits a note.
I love them!
This is the kind of video the internet was made for.
That was great.
I wish I was invited to that party
A real life Snoopy!
My mans slaying it on the keys.
"Such a tortured artist, so beautiful"
"Hey, I recgonize that!"
It's Buddy Mercury.
One of my dogs has decided it is past her bedtime and while I loved the video she responded to my listening to it with a huge groan of disgust and dismay.
I told her she sounds like an angry cow mooing and she gave me a look of pure outrage.
I like how the little girl actually enjoys the singing.
cute little wiggles
"Sing us a song, you're the piano man"
Her dance moves are killin me
This is the purest thing I've seen in a while.
thanks i love it
Drunk friends
Awooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
They just need a kitty in the background pushing items off a table to complete the circle
Start a band

Howl at the tune
"Aww man, this just made me miss my sweet beagle."

Where that super-like button at?
Some much pain in the lil guy 🥺

This is Buddy Mercury.
He has a youtube channel!
This should be in netflix.
Toddlers are insanity packaged small.
They take all of your energy and mental capacity and leave you feeling exhausted.
But dang do I miss it sometimes.
They’re full of so much personality

Thats talent
R/beagle material right here
My last 2 brain cells when I have a paper due in 20 minutes
"Absolute banger, can't help but sing along"
isn't he trying to copy the sound ?
that's quite impressive
[Sounds like that dog could team up with this one.
I’m digging the piano key dog collar lol
and I guess that's why they call it the woos.
Hey guys!
It's me!
Buddy Mercury!
The singing piano playing dog!
I just made a redit!
Arooooooo!
My dog used to do this on my toy piano growing up.
"God, I miss him."
I love the way the dogs tail wags during his performance
Gotta find the right key to howl to!
That dog has talent.
"Ok the toddler is cute and all, but that's pretty standard toddler cuteness."
The dog is the real amazing thing here.
I've never seen a dog do something like this.
When I see dogs playing the piano and howling I like to think they were an amazing piano player in a previous life.
"Tonight at this very second I feel very grateful to see this video while still being alive, Thank you stranger."
Thank you for this.
I'm having a rough go of it these days and this has been one of the few things to make me smile in a while.
I love your life.
Also.
I just found out how empty mine is.
Thank!
"If your party isn't this lit, don't bother inviting me."

I love that he almost seems to know what he's doing!
Dog literally goes r/aww
Betwooooven
Way off key.
Could use some bark lessons.
The greatest party there ever was
Dog can really sing the blues.
Any clues on what happened?
Nobody sings the blues like a beagle sings the blues.
This is my video.
I'm so happy you shared it!
We have a mission to make the world happy and also get more animals adopted!
We have a website with merchandise (buddymercury dot com)) a pawcentage of the profits goes to help animal rescues!

This is so goddamn precious.
Made my day.
This reminds me of that video of a something like a ‘typical UK bar at 11am’?
This is me at karaoke night.
Didn't that guy used to play for the Beagles?
I've never wanted to pet a dog more in my entire life
"Dog: ""Pick it up, bitch; we got 15 more choruses to do."
This just made my shitty day great.

I love this so much.
I could watch this for hours
I just put down my beagle on Saturday I miss hearing him howl at the birds.
Shes got a best friend for sure :)
"I want so much more of this, like hours of it."
I'd watch it on endless loop.
Aw I just noticed the doggo has a keyboard design on his collar.
He's definitely got a rep
What a party animal!

That dog is more talented than all of the Kardashians put together.

I would pay good money to watch that dog play live at Carnegie Hall
This should just be a channel.
It’s just meeee and the blues
Reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes.
Titles are everything!
This one is perfect.
I didn't play with sound on.
"For some reason I'm imagining the dog singing ""Mama oh oh ohooooo"" part of Bohemian Rhapsody."
"Presenting, Woofgang Amadeus Mozart"
His technique's a bit ruff.
Great voice though.
That is the fucking best thing I’ve ever seen.
"""Sing us a song you're the piano dog."
That dog is a better pianist and singer than I am.
That was the greatest thing I’ve seen in weeks.
Is it just or am I the only one who has noticed that a baby and a dog are the ultimate duo.
"I just love this video, it's pure joy and happiness!"
This is the best video I’ve seen in quite a while.
"Lol when she drops the toy and the dog looks over like ""Oh shit you good?"
I've literally been at this party before.
Just more Ouzo and not nearly as adorable.
That kid's music taste is going to be weird as fuck when they grow up
I freaking love his solo twords the end.
He speaks to the soul.
AHWHOooo.
AHWHOooo.
AWHOoooo.
Both of them would be a perfect fit for a NPC character animation on a video game.
Just a busker band consist of animal and a dancing baby playing music on a side walk.
Bloody dog thinks he's smarter than me just because he plays the piano better.

This is totally a scene from a Disney cartoon!

Oh my gosh those two are so cute.

", just two good friends having a great and wonderful time."
The band is really coming together
"I really needed this lol, I feel like it healed part of my soul"
Can I hire this band for my next party
I’d go to this party.
I give the dog a lot of credit.
It’s not easy to play the piano and sing at the same time!
This is the best thing I’ve seen all week!
This put the biggest smile on my face maybe ever.
One of the cutest things I've ever seen.
Thanks for sharing.
🤩 i love it Play it like a jazz set doggy-o.
I would love to know what's going on in dog's heads when they do this.
"Is it like pushing a bruise that hurts, but also feels good?"

But you say he's just a friend .
did I just watch a dog play the piano while singing a song?
That dog is literally playing the piano and singing a song.
My father is a piano teacher and this dog still plays better than my lazy ass.

I don't know what the hell is going on in the most wonderful way
And the extreme side effects consist of:
"It wont suddenly disappear, it will undergo extremely rigorous decade long testing procedures to see if it actually works, and to figure out any and all potential side effects before rolling it out for human test cases, and assuming it passes ALL OF THAT, it will become available for normal use."
Edit: typo (to normal use -> for normal use)
This things disappear because they can’t pass clinical trials or aren’t as effective as originally stated.
Headlines always jump to make claims like this
In vitro.
"I like that getting it to not destroy healthy brain tissue is classed as ""refining"""
"It’s not that these things disappear it’s just these results are often preliminary, covering experiments done in cell lines or genetic models like mice."
"Man I hate the notion that the government, or whoever you want to blame, actively tries to destroy cures to diseases and shit."
"Spreading this type of opinion is what leads to things like anti-vaxers, because they believe that the medical community is out to get them"

Jesus Christ the tin foil hats in this thread is ridiculous
It will disappear because its completely bullshit
Why would it suddenly stop existing?
"This idea that big pharma is an all controlling, all powerfull, only for profit org that manipulates meds is the source of anti-vax scare and things alike."
"The truth is, from working in a lab, in vitro, in specific situations, to the market is a hard, long, and, for these types of drugs, near impossible task"
This is dumb as shit why is this one me_irl
God I fucking hate garbage posts like this.
"Misrepresented science, and asking to share."
I thought better of r/me_irl
"I dont think people realize this stuff never ""disappears"", in the sense that the government hides it(?"
I am not saying it's the case for this but people usually exaggerate these headlines into something that was never there or ready in the first place.
"Oh, it's just channel 11."
Now if 13 abc reported it.
Hurry!
Hide the stash before the government gets to it.
Things that didn't happen for 500
"Anytime you see a headline/tweet state refer to the researchers as students, it's not very substantive."
You can tell when the coms department of a university is trying to over hype while under play something by referring to them as students.
"If it's more legit, you'll see that they refer to them as researchers, biologists, chemists, physicsists whatever, and later when they talk about them they'll say ""Xyz, a graduate student in X lab"" or ""zyx, an undergraduate student in x department."
Holy fuck there really are some brainlets on this sub isn’t there
you guys better save the formula before the government kills the students
I don't get the joke.

"It won’t disappear, it’s just gonna cost 1."
5 billion dollars per vial.
"I went there for my doctorate, I did my research there, my friends did their research right in that lab too."
For the school size and funding they find some interesting outcomes for chemicals.
"When I was there they were working on using Cobra venom for drug development, and many other natural sources of possible pharmaceuticals."
This is why Twitterfingers need to stay out of science.
"There are so many different factors *in vivo* that aren't even remotely factored in, in an *in vitro* setting."
"They're making this sound like these kids have developed some breakthrough cure, but big bad pharma is going to shut them down."
There are millions of ways to cure cancers and other diseases when it's in a test tube.
"A massive percentage of them fail when introduced into animal models, and even higher amounts wash out in the clinic."
"I'm no expert, but there's a 99% chance this is greatly exxagerted and won't actually work as portrayed."
This shit happens all the time.
why is this on this sub?
I’m more concerned about improper ppe ie no gloves
I don't believe any of this shit anymore
You forgot the funny
Jesus- I just noticed the comments are arranged in order of “best”.
Maybe Reddit isn’t the place for me after all.
Reading the “best” comments is worse than watching idiots crack themselves up at local improv night.
Educational institutions don't generally design drugs.
We like to pioneer new ideas that may be applicable to drug design for certain illness or ailments.
Campus isn't going to spend $1 billion dollars on trials and testing because a grad student published a paper with nice results.
"Oh please let this:1) Pass clinical trials, and 2) Not be bought out by a Big Pharma company and then priced at $5000 a dose."
Ready to start human trials in just 200 years

MAKE THIS GO VIRAL
My mother passed away 8 years ago from a glioblastoma tumor.
I really hope this treatment will be able to help others.
Few things to burst your bubble:Glioblastoma isn't a homogeneous disease.
Disease subgroups exist and its split between childhood and adult.
"Even if this drug works, it'll only work for a subset of patients."
We don't know how many people it'll actually help.
And if it helps it might only prologue survival not cure outright.
100x selectivity isn't that incredible.
But drugs can always be refined and made more selective.
"Still, it'll probably need years of development before it makes it to clinic."
If it ever does.
I can't find a paper for this.
Generally speaking you'd make a press release after a publication not before.
"If someone can link me, please do I'd like to read it."
Source: I work in paediatric brain tumour research.
Why would big pharma suddenly erase this?
You really think they would miss out on a cash cow like that where they can set the price point extraordinarily high?
Blows my mind how people think the government and big pharma would rather have people dead than sick and alive
Meirl
"Great, now how can I reverse it so it just kills me?"
Isn't this how I am Legend started?
*takes the unrefined version so my whole brain gets destroyed*
i graduated from UF!
They're doing great things!
"Shoutout Ohio, we’re finally doing something right here"
I'm happy this is getting spread around but why is this on this sub?
Hey my home town!
"Thick stool, anal leakage and possible blindness, but just in one eye."
"They ""refined"" it to ignore healthy brain cells?"
So their first concoction straight up killed you?
"It will go through decades of testing, longer due to a human drug most likely, and if everything is passed in accordance it will be bought up by a big monopoly and sold for thousands a dose"
I don’t get it lmao
"it takes new drugs 10-15 years of testing before they can get from lab to patients, the students are only on year 2 according to an article by NBC so we most likely won’t hear more about this for some time"
"People saying it's not that good may be correct, but it's still a huge scientific advancement."
Change my opinion.
"Could ya throw on some gloves, big guy?"
This is awesome.
I'm actually about to cry for all the people who lives are about to be saved.
Absolutely groundbreaking.
How am I just learning about?
I'm at a lost for words.
Edit: Wait what this isn't real?
But your pepe falls off .
No joke.
I work in Findlay OH at a local cell phone store.
"Roughly a year ago, this lady came in saying she was working with a professor on this EXACT project!"
"She was trying her best to explain it to me, but I seriously had very little idea what she was talking about."
One of the smartest people I've talked to in some time.
"I wrote it off as some ole' bullmess, but here we are a year later."
Pretty cool.
Just hope this doesn't get shot down.

best thing you've ever done
Holy fuck I wake up this morning to see this post at 100k upvotes.
I never expected this.
"thank you guys so much, I will **try** to get through as many comments as I can."
Why the fuck does this have 188k Upvotes?
Great work on making Snapchat's facial filters relevant again!

Ahh the good ol' *I bought SNAP wayyyy too high and need to subliminally advertise to the masses to get myself out of this hole* …  *Classic* millennial move
This is the best thing I've done on snapchat.
Then posted to Twitter.
So it can be submitted on reddit.
Then plastered all over facebook.
Then forwarded from grandma.
There's no way Snap chat is worth 21 Billion dollars.
Take my upvote and fuck off

What is the worst thing you've done on snapchat?
OP I SAW YOU RECORDING THIS

This may well be the best thing *that has been done* with snapchat.
"I wish you could change that rainbow shit to like blood, like in the animes."
This is the best thing you've done on reddit

Coincidentally also the best thing you've done on reddit.

Snap ends up front page a few days after IPO.
hard to believe this wasn't fabricated
This is the best thing that has ever come from Snapchat.

I agree this is the best thing you have done on snapchat.

I don't know what this is but it's still awesome as fuck.
This is fake.
Anyone who's used snapchat knows as soon as you zoom into a far away object it becomes very low quality and grainy and hard to keep steady.
/hailcorporate
That's probably the best thing I've ever seen from a snapchat filter that doesn't include boobs.
"I remember when these snapchat filters first came out and I thought ""wow these are stupid, no one is ever gonna use them"" and here I am checking snapchat on the daily to see if there's any different filters"
"In less than half a day, this post has over half the karma of Barack Obama's AMA, the most upvoted post on Reddit of all time."
"Congratu-fucking-lations, OP."
This is incredible.
Do the baby giraffe please!
Blatant advertising.
This site is such shit
Funny that you post this today.
"I have no idea where or what this is, but about two hours ago I was looking at YouTube videos of dentists removed bad plaque/tartar from feet he and a recording of this statue was used in the background for title cards in between different shots."
I can find and post a link if anyone wants.
Yawn.
Another shit not funny post
This is supposed to be funny?
This is the only time I've enjoyed this effect.
Congratulations
But why can't I find face swap anymore?
this deserves to be front page
This is the only reason I bought their stock.
I think that's the best thing I've seen on snapchat.
I agree
This is from my dreams.

Great Ride⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
"Jokes on you, the S&G ride is just the song Sounds of Silence played at half speed and on repeat for the entirety of the ride."
"Spent 4 years of my youth just outside of Fairbanks, Alaska and can confirm the Informative Ride is #truth."
The driver was an elderly man with a BEYOND immaculate car.
It was clear he took his job seriously and wanted everyone to have a pleasant ride.
10/10 wholesome.
EDIT: The driver has given permission to reveal his name.
"It’s Jeffrey, and he’s a Vietnam vet."
Driving helps fund his retirement.
"If you find yourself in Fairbanks, try to catch a ride from him, and ask him about his famous “monkey story."
We ended up with “The Informative” and a side of “Restaurant.
” Quite pleasant
I want to ride with him a lot.
I want all the rides
I love how the Sounds of Silence ride has a blank beneath it.
Beautiful.
Wow that's really weird that Fairbanks has uber now.
"Simon and Garfunkel, all day everyday"
Is this the cab company from “Nathan for you”?
I’ll have the restaurant with a side of Simon and Garfunkel please
You gave him/her 5 stars right?
This is already way too much interaction
Yoooo Fairbanks represent
Welcome to Alaska.
Or are you someone who also lives there?
"I'm not at Fairbanks, but I think that this man's set up is pretty cool."
Hey that’s my town!
I love this.
"Ahh, the political ride."
An important lesson for us all.
"He should number them for easy selection, especially for the majority of people, who would obviously prefer The Simon and Garfunkel and would much rather just say “#7 please” (less interaction)"
Dude you have to go with the life lessons come on.
A driver like this must have some sagely wisdom
Instead if the driver starts talking to me I just say I have to listen to an audio book to prepare for a test.
"I’m usually firmly in the *Sound of Silence* camp, but I think I’d made an exception here."
I’d pick road rage and sit back with a smile on my face while he went off on why Audi drivers are asshats.
Fairbanks has Uber!
I don’t usually like talking in the Uber but if it’s about something I choose I can see actually wanting to talk.
Like I hate when it’s the same generic questions about my day and such but if we can talk about good local restaurants I think that’s pretty cool
Gotta try Turtle Club fam!
Get that turtle cut or miner's cut if you're a beast.
"Havent taken an Uber here, but if I need one I hope I get this guy!"
Even if I don't need to know about the restaurants or the city.
The no-talking feature in Uber is genius and is now in my profile
Yo hasnt something like this been posted before?
"I'd be tempted with simon and garfunkel, but with an older guy I probably ask for life lessons."
More chance for a good memory.
Even a bad one gives a story.
A boring one though.
what a risk
My two favorites are:Wackjob conspiracy nut.
“Ask me about Sandy Hook!
"”And “Super Racist Man” that peppers the ride with 10+ comments about how he’s happy I’m white and then explains why he ignores calls in bad neighborhoods because of, and I’m quoting here, “The Darkies”."
"He forgot ""the married couple ride"" He drives and you pretend to be his wife criticizing like fuck every move he makes."
These are getting weird.
Does anyone just not give a ride anymore?
I don't need topic or themed rides.
I don't need Super Nintendo.
"The 50 chargers are ok, but still not necessary."
All I want is a ride.
Repost from like a year ago.
"After 5 minutes with my husband, he will only be serving Simon and Garfunkel."
"I do not like, in general, the little signs on the back of seats no matter what they say."
It makes the whole thing feel weird for me.
"Sounds like a cool dude, but I have to disagree with the political one."
"ALL opinions should be open to change, given a convincing enough argument."
Refusing to change political opinions is exactly why the US is so polarized.
Man one time my Uber stopped at the gas station and said I could get a roadie.
Man was a genius.
This NPC has a ridiculous dialogue tree!
r/outside
"These are annoying reposts/karma farms, stop it,"
I spent 5 years in Fairbanks at the University and I have a guess or two on who might the driver be.
"It’s so trippy to see your own town on the front page of Reddit, but you have to go to Ajimi’s next time you come here if you’re a fan of sushi"
❤️ when I was in Fairbanks most of my Uber drivers had the same sense of humor !
But I would have taken the informative ride because my week stay was definitely not long enough !
What a beautiful state
Did you let him use his skills learned from a photography class to take this photograph?
Good idea for meeting new people in general.
I wish “no talking” was a request and a compliment “great quiet ride” instead of only “great convo”
Political Ride.
I listen to Ben Shapiro and Pod Save America.
Which one do you want to listen to?
WE MADE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE BOYS!
FAIRBANKS IS FINALLY REPRESENTED!
He's an awesome guy that is about as Alaskan as they come.
I met him a few months before he retired.
Was still in the Army in 2003-2004 with a Vietnam combat patch!
You did it 100k updoots i am proud of you
"The description of ""The Political Ride"" is awesome."
More people should have that mentality
Hmm two “super fun Uber driver” type posts at the top of the sub.
I’m gonna on my tin foil hat on and say Uber has had some bad PR lately around how they treat their drivers.
How about the silent ride?
REPOST 😡
This is so awesome!
You can tell he put a lot of thought into this.
Love this.
"What a great way to be able to choose the silent ride, or a conversation of your choice."
"Personally, assuming I was an infrequent tourist to AK, I would just choose a buffet: (1) Tell me *briefly* yourself; (2) tell me, *briefly*, what you think are the best things to see in AK; (3) tell me, *briefly*, what are life's ""most essential lessons""; and (4) if I am eating meals in Fairbanks, what's a ""hidden gem"" and any ""secrets"" about it."
"And, if I want more detail on any of these, I will ask follow-up questions."
"And, I can go to ""silent ride,"" at any time."
"The political ride is very much appreciated, since I have a friend who keeps complaining to me about politics and how my opinion is idiotic, according to him."
Wholesome
I’d be fine with having them talk to me as long as I didn’t have to talk back.
This.
this is incredible
This has been posted before
This is some Nathan for you shit hahah
Compared to the miserable cabbie drivers in my town that look at you as an inconvenience and expect a hefty tip even though they mumble and grunt about during the whole ride.
God forbid they have to help someone load their luggage.
vancouver cabbies are the worst.
This is so cute and makes me smile :)
I would absolutely choose The Me Ride as my primary choice.
Listening to someone talk about their life is so fun.
Does that come with the fare or extra charge?
Omg 10 stars.
This is amazing
I want to tip that driver now.
I’d like to take a number 1 and a number 3
"That’s great and all, but you HAVE to get the crepes in Fairbanks downtown."
Best I’ve had in my life.
"Once on a an Uber drive in Portland, my best friend and I helped my driver decide she was going to break up with her boyfriend and move back home."
It was one of the best trips of my life.
There's something about talking to a stranger about your problems that is just so cathartic.
That kinda awesome.
Road rage every time
Was this Jeffery?
Nathan for you
Pretty interesting guy.
I'd go for the ME Ride
Oh crap!
Never thought I'd see my home town on the front page wow.
Love how there's a gap after the Sounds Of Silence option.
Subtle.
Check out Hoodoo and silver gulch while you're there.
Come on!
You have to tell us which one you chose!
I'll have the Road Rage with a side of GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE FAST LANE YOU WORTHLESS COCKRING!
WHERE'D YOU GET YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE?
CLOWN SCHOOL?
I seriously thought that’s what it was.
Till I read the caption.
"By the way, not to toot my own horn, but I caught it on the garage door after owning my brand new car for a grand total of 3 days!"
"Edit: I have to say thank you to everyone for the great response to this post, all the gold and silver, and for getting me to the front page for the second time in 5 days."
This is perfect for r/misleadingthumbnails
Dude that's insane.
almost made me dizzy til my brain finally figured it out.
r/confusing_perspective
that's a Black Ops II map
I’m still not fully convinced this is not a partly sunken boat.
Absolutely guarantee this is going to be one of the most reposted pics of summer 2019.
Totally thought it was a boat.
My brain couldn’t even figure out the antenna part for a few seconds.
r/submechanophobia
I thought it was a half sunken boat 🚢
I actually have to *force* my brain to see a car and not a boat.
So cool.
Definitely what it looks like .
Without reading your comment that what I thought then I read you comment and was like whoa
"Hey /u/ogre_easy,This is now the top post on reddit."
This is quality
Thought this was r/misleadingthumbnails for a sec.
I can't sea that being very expensive to fix.
The lack of reception mast drive you nuts.
I bet any parts store could ship you a new antenna.
It should nautical be a problem.
Ok I'm done.
"Uh, that’s NOT a half sunken boat?"
You sunk my battleship!
"Yar, she was a fine vessel."
Wait.
What antenna?
I would love to see this retouched🙏
You have quite the imagination ma'am.
damn straight it does
Took me a while to realize what I was actually staring at
"It took me forever to convince myself this wasn’t a sinking boat, even though I read the title before the picture."
Looks like indisputable proof that Iran damaged your car.
I legit thought it was a boat.
"And I read part of the post, thought where the heck is the antennae, read the rest, and realized how warped my perspective was."
"Nah, your boat is sinking bro."
Your half sunken boat looks like a close up of a broken car antenna.
NOW I understand.
"I was playing over in my mind how an antenna could have a base that appears this big, and it occurred to me, this is one of those rooftop sharkfin antennas."
"which would mean this is probably located toward the rear of your rooftop, and the seam displayed on the top right of your picture is probably where your car's rear window slopes down."
But yes.
without that context.
this looks EXACTLY like what you said!
I love to try and figure out photos like this!
"National Geographic World (For kids) used to have a section called ""What In The World"" and I loved to look at it."
Kudos!
At first glance I thought that’s what this was lol
Honestly thought it was a boat at first glance.
Holy shit!
Thats at least 2000 dollars a night
It looks like a boat sinking in space.
"Trippy, and with a bit of photoshop to remove the trees the illusion would be perfect."
“Are we dropping Hijacked?
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down of the big lake they call Gitchi-Gami.
You got me
I'm not convinced this isn't a half sunken boat
a subaru ?
This.
This fucked me up a bit.
I fucken thought it was a boat for two minutes
That is precisely what I assumed it was until I read the headline.
I was looking at this for ages without reading the caption and thought it was a boat hahah
Holy shit.
"I already know it is what it is, but seriously can I exchange my amex points to book a weekend there?"
I though it was a futuristic floating house or something
"Authorities are still working to determine what sunk the vessel, but as you can see from the SkyNews 10 helicopter  it appears part of the ship at least remains above water."
I seriously thought that it was done kind of futuristic boat
Great.
Iran sank another boat.
I thought this was hijacked on BO4 😂😂
It took me way too long to notice what it really was
I did not know this wasn’t a sunken boat until I read the headline.
Liar.
Its a sunken boat
I look at the pictures before reading titles and I the picture made me anticipate a boat related title
r/miniworlds
The trees in the reflection threw me off
I still looked at it for like 30 second after reading the caption before realizing that the surface is not water but the car.
I thought it's real before reading the caption
"Was a nice boat, till it sank :/"
I was drunk last night when I saw this and actually thought you were lying about not seeing a sunken ship.
"111,000 upvotes."
For a radio boat.
Most convincing picture of a boat half sunk in the water ive seen.
The tree reflecting really helps make it believable.
There’s no way that’s not a half sunken boat
Wait.
It's not a boat?
I thought it was.
"Not gonna lie, I took shrooms the other day and am only now just coming back to look at this and realize that it's not actually a half sunken boat."
"Like, I read the title to it a million times, but couldn't see anything other than the half sunken boat."
"that took me a good 30 seconds before i saw ""car"""
OP broke his antenna for that sweet sweet karma.
Holy ship
It's not a boat?
Your half-sunken repost?
Did someone tug it out?
reddit.
Oh woah thats cool
I for real thought this was in water when I first looked at it
I was staring at it thinking it was a sunken boat for a few minutes before reading your headline!
hahaha
Better graphics than some video games
Titanic music commence
My allergies kicked off hard when I realized what this was
I had to close one eye and zoom in
Your half sunken boat looks like the broken antenna on car I just saw.
I actually thought this was a boat before reading the title
same shape and paint color as my Chevy Cruze
My dumb ass thought this was a chicken breast
"Yup, saw a boat."
Even after reading the caption I saw boat for a few seconds.
Almost took an effort to not see boat.
Boat.
The reflection of the trees make this really look like a sunken boat wow
I'm thinking a Bond villain's super-sweet sea lair.
I think a broken antenna is the least of this boats problems.
"Just sit right back and you'll hear a talea tale of a fateful trip,that started from this tropic port,aboard this tiny ship."
Woah bro
*James Cameron Intensifies*
I thought it was some surreal drawing of a boat travelling in space.
Those dots look like stars
Put it up for auction!
That’s so funny
Without reading the title I really thought it was a half sunken boat!
Thought this was the QualifiedCaptain on Instagram at first.
Then remembered I was on reddit.
"You got me, friend."
took a hot minute to understand what was going on
It took me longer to see the antenna than I want to admit.
This is crazy.
Murky as hell water
Wow I immediately jumped too the half-sunken boat conclusion before reading the caption.
Incredible!
Bruh i thought this was some star wars shit
That’s some next level imagination
"titanic, who?"
That's an unfortunate state for the antenna but the photo is great.
Super neat!
Yoooo.
This broke my brain!
*illusion 100*
I skimmed the title and started looking at the antenna on the boat.
Then I realized that's not a boat.
"Crazy how close it is, this is the first one that's got me, great post."
"The tree reflection helps the illusion, too!"
I kept wondering which part of the boat had the broken antenna.
It took me probably a solid minute of staring.
Took me forever to unsee the boat.
"Yes, this is all I can see."
Even full size.
Broken An-titanic.
"Huh I thought this was a half sunk boat, then read the heading."
Well done .
I bet there's a giant anaconda slithering in the depths of that river under the boat.
It's a good thing that your antenna broke in shallow water or things could have gone much differently.
"Wow, had me fooled."
I thought it was a picture of a boat taken overhead via a drone.
I have a sunken feeling about your radio reception.
i didnt read the title and i thought thats exactly what it was
First thought was why is he calling this sunken ship an antenna.
I agree .
Thought it was a sunken boat😂😂
You can't fool me.
That's a half sunken boat right there.
This picture pisses me off and i don't know why.
Boba phett
That is a yacht
Brody's gonna climb up onto the top part of the boat that hasn't sunk yet and shoot the oxygen tank in the shark's mouth.
"Right place, right picture, right time."
Hot damn.
Hyundai Elantra?
Dude it looks like alot of shit.
"Started with mini sunken town Atlantis kindof thing, then, cool kindof boat sunk or in a gear or so"
Yes it does
I thought it looked like the flooded Ellis Island from The Expanse.
"Wash your car, my dude."
I thought this was on r/shipwrecks
"Maybe it’s time for me to stop playing EVE, I thought this was screenshot from it"
Cool.
"I too, thought, it was a half sunken boat."
"Man, the trees really give it the effect they're  reflecting of the ""water"""
This is what I come here for.
This is peak mildly interesting
Accurate!
"Ah, r/mildlyinteresting at its finest"
I thought it was actual .
May you sail this all the way to the front page.
"Perhaps I'm a bit tipsy, but your post is perfect."
titantenna
Woah that’s really cool.
Did anyone else think it looked like a Fortnite map with the storm closing in?
you have to let go jack
i thought it was a remote control boat untill i looked at tittle
That’s a half sunken boat.
I might still be drunk.
looks like a boat for me
"I read the caption and knew what to expect, but my brain insisted it was a boat in water for a good 5 seconds before I could finally see it right."
Put a little helicopter on it and take another picture.
Edit :Tiny helicopter
Ford Fusion?
"Same thing happened to me last winter while brushing snow off the car, those antenna housings are ridiculously fragile."
Hory chet it does 😂
I had to blink a couple of times to realize it’s not a boat sailing in the ocean lol
Holy shit
Holy shit- I can't see anything *but* a boat
Forester?
R/confusingprospective
Idk where this guy sees an antenna.
He clearly posted a picture of a boat that’s about to sail off the edge of a flat earth.
Holy shit I had to blink my eyes like 19 times and reread the title twice to get it.
Good eye
I kept reading the title trying to figure out why a broken antenna sunk a ship.
Not my brightest moment.
Really dooby do be lookin like a boat
I looked at the picture before I read the title and you are right sir lmao
A sunken boat or a case of (implications)
I legit scrolled past and was like why is there a random picture of a boat on my feed.
My my how I was shook after realizing the caption.
I got fuckin confused
You can buy a replacement on wish for like 3$ btw 😀
"I thought this was your car key fob, broken in half and semi submerged."
"""I'll never let go Jack!"
Looks exactly like one.
Did not realize till I read the title.
That isn't an accident.
Boats are shaped like that to handle the waves.
"Why do you think they call them ""radio waves?"
"""TMYK"
"Lol I was like, 'How is that little white thing his/her car?"
' The I looked closer.
'OOOOHHHH I SEE IT
r/mildlyinteresting is a trip.
Almost 300 comments and no upvotes lol.
I was fooled by a frikkin antenna
*Plays my heart will go on*
Looks like a half sunken LEGO boat
Ah shit my head just melted
My drunk ass looked at this for a minute before I saw it was indeed part of a car
"My son, who is looking over my shoulder instead of falling asleep, just said, “is that a boat sinking?"
This is one of the craziest pictures I’ve seen in a while man.
It’s perfect.
That's such a sweet picture
Mind fucked
Or is it Major Tom?
Drifting across the space.
It legit took me 5 minutes looking at it to figure it out.
This is seriously difficult to distinguish
"I shit you not, I glanced at this picture without reading the title and thought ""Ouch, some poor bastard is going to have a hard time getting his boat back."
That one smudge even makes it look like it’s a yacht with an onboard pool that’s already under!
Really neat illusion
"I thought it was a nice photo of a boat, but my brain exploded when I understood what it really was."
Gameplay footage from Death Stranding (2019)
I legitimately thought that this was art of a space boat.
Cannot usnsee
"Pardon my curiosity, do you own a BMW?"
I’ve always wondered what is under those “tail fins” on the roof
Nice try nautical guy.
I didn’t read the text first and legit thought that’s what it was
My heart will go on
Also looks like a spaceship
All I see is boat
It look me a while
Damn.
That's an incredible optical illusion right there.
*I HAVE A CHIIIILLLLLDDDD!
"I broke this, cost $18,000 to repair"
Is this the sharkfin antennae from a lexus?
Were you going on a three hour tour?
I’m not convinced it isn’t
Is that a MINI or BMW?
"Two, two barrels maybe, but not three barrels."
A car wash ate mine within the first month of owning it.
&#x200B;Doesn't look as cool though :(&#x200B;Return of the [speed fin.
Stunning
Yeah I definitely did a hard furrowed brow double take
Holy shit.
What car?
What antenna?
From the thumbnail I legit thought it was a boat!
I thought it was some futuristic yacht submarine
Car paint looks pretty cool up close.
"Looks like bmw carbon black metallic paint (not saying it is, but really looks like it)."
"My favorite color, would put it on any car I care about."
Wow i saw exactly that before reading the title.
So that’s not a sunken boat?
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
It's so convincing
I initially thought it was a partially built mansion surrounded by asphalt
It's kinda.
"Wierd that a ""mildlyinteresting"" post is top post on the front page."
Are we that bored?
Yes we are.
Only read the first few words of the title and wondered why OP was worried about a broken antenna on his sinking boat.
Damn I’m fried out of my mind and this is hard to grasp
"I was seriously thinking, where on this boat is the antenna?"
This is more than mildly interesting imo
"I swear, OP has a boat."
"This ones gonna be big, awesome photo."
This looks like a poor render of a multi-player fps map.
Smallish map good for ctf and death map.
"Exactly, it's really hard to differentiate, it took me few seconds to sort out."
Nice click afterall.
A three hour tour.
Somebody call 111!
It really does.
Thank you for sharing.
Ford?
Possibly Fusion?
This reminds me of visiting the Arizona in Hawaii.
There's even an oil trail.
What makes this all the more scummy is that they also took back ALL of the winners prize money.
"A tournament they touted so much, flaunted the 'massive' winnings."
"yet the moment they gotta pay up, they just yank them right back into their pocket and ban/condemn the winner of their Tournament entirely."
So where did the money go Blizzard?
You wanna at least pay out the other players?

"Stand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom."
Guys.
"Can we all get together and make it so Blizzards, Activisions, EAs, and NBAs start being afraid to lose WESTERN markets?"
Sounds like they take us for granted.

"I played wow for 12 years, since launch, but quit a few years ago when the company had devolved to the point I couldn't tolerate it anymore."
"&#x200B;I'd been thinking about starting it up again to play classic again and see what has changed, but that is certainly not happening now."
Screw that company.
They sold their soul a long time ago.
As a longtime fan of Blizzard's games: Blizzard is a fucking joke for doing this.
By accomodating China's ruthless regime they're also guilty of working AGAINST basic human rights across the globe.
The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared martial law and sent the military to occupy central parts of Beijing.
"In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre (Chinese: 天安门大屠杀), troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square."
"Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded."
Ever wonder how some companies were morally corrupted enough to assist the Nazi in killing jews in WW?
We are watching some in real time right now.
It is couple days after South Park episode.
How ironic.
Fuck Blizzard.
"I've put more than 10,000 hours of my life into their games over the last 20+ years, and they've always held a special place in my heart, but that ends today."
I can't support this.
It breaks my heart.
"It feels like I've lost a close friend, but this bullshit cannot be tolerated."
"We cannot budge an inch on this, no matter what."
Jesus.
What a fucking shitshow.

What’s this about?
I am out of the loop
Blizzard.
I was *this* close to resubbing to WoW for the winter.
But now it looks like I’ll have to find another game to play.
"Any ideas, hivemind?"
"I was considering Divinity: Original Sin 2, but I’m open to suggestions."
Fooking kneelers
Isn’t Diablo mobile a big announcement during their Blizzcon co-developed with NetEase after all ?
For me that says it all regarding Blizzard priorities: chinese market.
They are far from being alone: From governments to Apple everyone wants their share of this market and are ready to give up on all their principles !
"In china your ICloud is not yours alone, apparently many people/servers can get a peek inside this sensitive dataset"
"Huh, guess I don't need to play Classic after all."
I’ve been giving blizzard so much money for years but they’re not getting a penny out of me after this.
"Also watch this post get removed by the mods or admins cuz Reddit also takes china moneyEdit with timing / context: a mod replied below and said the post stays but that constant repeats of similar posts do get removed, which I agreed was fair and thanked them for their transparency."
"The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: 六四事件, liùsì shìjiàn), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989."
"More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn)."
The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law.
"In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square."
"The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000."
r/blizzard has gone private
**Liberty Prime intensifies* *
"how the fuck do they manage to outdo themselvesFrom just turning their games to shit, insulting plans on beloved franchises, to just outright advocating for suppression of basic human rights"
So glad I said fuck this company years ago and refuse to give them money
#BoycottBlizzard
"Please, please, cancel your subs, don’t log in, don’t spend money."
"At the very least, do this for a single month."
"Hit hard against the corporate pandering to human right violations now, or it will get worse."
China is rampaging and it will require world push back to contain.
Blizzard has really changed for the worst.
I can no longer support them or buy/play their games after this.
The company that goes to extremes at times to look politically correct is actively against basic human rights for the people of Hong Kong.
"The company that is helping China put a boot on people's throat also changed a Tracer pose because one offended parent made a post on the forum about not wanting their daughter to see a character do an ""over the shoulder"" pose where her butt was visible."
Blizzard taking position for the chinese autocracy.
"The BlizzCon is soon, good opportunity to get in contact with Blizzard."
Don't stop.
Meme the shit out of this.
Blizzard is cold as ice
I wish I could take back all that money I've spend on Blizzard games over the past 20 years.
"I could never have imagined that this kind of stuff would happen in entertainment/art industry, I always saw entertainment/art as something that would comment on what's going on in the world and not bend over backwards to fascist regimes!"
"Battlenet uninstalled, thank you Blizzard for endless hours of high-end entertainment, you was among the very best, now you can f\*\*k right off."
(sad smiley)
"From Blizzard’s official post:>Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard’s image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize to $0 USDSo since Blizzard is offending everyone and damaging their own image, we get to reduce their money to $0 USD, right?"

I went to Contact Us and navigated their web of options and when I finally got to an appropriate link THEY WANTED A GOV'T ISSUED PHOTO ID TO HAVE ME TALK TO THEM.
Boycott Blizzard!
"Well, time to cancel that Reforged preorder"
And here goes all of my wishes to get back to play any of blizzard's games

"Since they only care about money, hit them where it hurts."
"Officially nobody bows down to chinese governmentIn fact all do, look at the houston basketball team, they feel all the force of China,"
"Fuck China, fuck Blizzard, fuck Winnie the Pooh"

Is there a go fund me for the winners?
"Dont buy , dont play , dont give them a single cent and refund if you can."
if you're against what they're doing.
"considering they want to go even deeper into the mobile """"""""gaming"""""""" market (and guess where it's the biggest), are you even surprised?"
"I was about to post in a very snarly manner about how we shouldn't be supporting blizzard after their actions, glad I don't have to."
"Fuck Blizzard, fuck Activision, fuck everyone involved in making this decision."
Just remember.
Everytime blizzard makes a tweet supporting international womans day.
It's fake.
When they support pride month.
It's fake.
Black history month.
Fake.
This is a company that bends the knee to a country that would not allow black people in Diablo Immortal.
"A company that bent the knee to a country that did now allow anything ""gay related"" in overwatch."
They virtue signal.
They want those retweets and the digital back pats from people.
But what they only care about is money.
Not people.
Remember that.
Stand in solidarity with Hong Kong!
F**k China.
‘Hey China!
Guess what?
Nobody can see your wall from space!
We were lying!

Seems Blizzard needs some tegridy.
Fuck Blizzard.
Money grabbing Bitches.
Erase their Games now!
It’s simple.
Boycott the Blizzard.
A great company should never bow to a random world power.
"Cool, cancelling my WoW subscription and deleting BattleNet when I get home."
Fuck the Chinese government and fuck Blizzard
Open comment to Blizzard:I have been a staunch supporter of Blizzard for 25 years.
I've bought just about every title you've ever released and spent years subscribed to WoW.
I will be uninstalling all of your products from my computer.
Your decision is a grievous offense to all the Free People of the world.
"I know you will probably laugh all the way to the bank but for shame Blizzard, for shame."
This decision disgusts me.
-A former long time customer
Blizzard: makes games about heroes fighting evil.
"A fan: Fights evilBlizzard: Wait, that's illegal."
"Well, we do have smartphones and this is what we do with them"
Officially fuck Blizzard.
Might as well be a fucking Chinese company.
Never buying another blizzard game.
Fuck Blizzard.
They can go suck China's dick.
"The good news is that now that I've cancelled my WOW subscription and uninstalled Hearthstone, I'll have so much more free time on my plate!"
"Thank you, Blizzard, for giving me a compelling reason to not be your patron anymore."
welp i bought every blizz game that ever existed.
Never again.
They been going downhill for years.
Lets hope Rockstar and CDProjekt don't get corrupted.
Also Japanese companies will no way kowtow to China.
They deserve to be mocked.
Is this an out of season April fool's joke?
Fuck blizzard.
An advice for blizzard : hold the blizzcon in china !
"God damnit, Blizzard."
I've been playing your games since Warcraft 1.
Why the fuck did you have to go evil?
Pax is on in Melbourne this weekend and Blizzard are there.
I'm goin in boys
Fuck Blizzard
Another piece of shit company on my personal banned list
"Did the only thing I could do, voted with my wallet and pulled my wow subscription, and told them why in the reason section."
It's not much but it's something.
I really hope someone organizes a protest at blizzcon with attendees.
This is a serious issue.
"Wear shirts, bring signs if you're going."
"Skip the cosplay and stand up for human rights, democracy and freedom of speech"
Suppressing and punishing somebody for supporting Hong Kong is tantamount to condemning Hong Kong.
"Fuck China, fuck Blizzard."
"If your fucking Chinese investments mean more than basic human decency, you can get fucked as a game developer."
"I've defended Blizzard a lot, even after the Activision crap, but fuck this."
"Blizzard goes in the EA tier bin now, no more money to them ever again."
Cancelled WoW subscription and removed all payment options from my account.
I used to love Overwatch but didn't feel like playing for the past 2 days either.
"Sold all my Blizzard-related game merch aswell (Overwatch Lego, Funkopops, Bobbleheads, etc)I have to admit that this is the first time i really take shit like this personal and actively ""vote"" with my wallet."
Time to expand that to different areas of life aswell.
Fuck all these companies bowing down to China.
This is what happens when your country starts to renege on century old policy because a buffoon thinks he can make a buck off of Americans sweat and blood.
"Fuck Donald Trump, and China."
Blizzard is going to lose way more than they gained here.
"My friend texted me this morning to inform me he will not be subbing for classic wow in January, which we had planned for a couple months now to return to the game."
I will likely not sub either.
I'm sure we arent alone here.
Can someone edit Neville Chamberlain onto it?
Don't forget to sacrifice two of your own minions randomly as casting cost.

You want a shooter?
I'm sure you can find something.
"WoW has been rehashed a million times with all the expansions, and Wow classic."
Just move on.
well more reason for me to keep up my Activision-Blizzard boycott
But can I still play diablo 2?
Blizzard was good back then right?
The NBA and Blizzard sre cowards.
I loved this company for a long time.
They make some of my favorite games.
Sad that I won't get to play them anymore.
First the Diablo Mobile debacle and now this?
"They are selling all of the credibility they had in the name of profit, they are not getting my money anymore."
Just cancelled my WoW sub and made sure they knew why.
It's the very least I could do.
We should all downvote (1 star) the hearthstone app and tell them that its because their anti democracy policy!
So r/blizzard is now a locked page.
I wonder why they would do somthing like that?
*sadly uninstalls Overwatch*

Mine figured out how to wake me up 15ish minutes before the alarm goes off like the asshole that he is
I just suffered from massive cuteness overload and it's all your fault.
cuddly cats are best cats!
My corrupted soul can't take this.
This is too wholesome and pure
My cat does the same thing!
Occasionally I’ll use my phone alarm as a timer for the oven.
I’m just trying to make dinner and he thinks it’s cuddle time!
I feel awful about leading him on like that so I’ll hold off on my dinner for a few minutes to give him some love.
i started sleeping through some alarms a couple years ago.
"then one morning i woke up a little early, but stayed in bed until the alarm went off, only to see one of my cats jumping up and swiping at my phone."
effectively turning my alarm off.
then she laid back down next to me and went back to sleep.
now i set multiple alarms.
"So, I raised a kitten for my ex (long story but she didn't have time or resources to take care of it for a while there)."
A little orange tabby tomcat.
Very smart.
"If I didn't wake up by 7:30am to feed him breakfast and find a box for him to play in, I got my NOSE bitten you guys."
Hard.
He even drew some blood a couple times.
"No scratches, no meows, no nudges, just a bite on the nose while I'm deadass asleep."
I have no idea how he seized onto that idea.
Nobody taught him that and he wasn't very mouthy otherwise.
My cat’s the same way.
It’s been like that for seven years.
It makes it really hard to get out of bed when the real alarm goes off.
"When I was in kindergarten, I was a tiny kid (smallest in my class)."
We had this big black-and-white cat who would sit up on my chest so I couldn’t sit up.
My mom has to take him off me or I couldn’t get up.
"If I tried to roll over to get out from under him, he just reasjusted himself to the new leverage position"
"When I started having to work in an office, my two big boy cats became my littlest nopes."
"As soon as my alarm went off, both would snuggle up and place their paws firmly on my chest."
"“Nope, Hooman - just nope!"
"” - I did the same as the OP, and they loved their ‘extra’ half hour cuddle."
Lucky.
My cat thinks that she is the alarm clock and it's her job to go off at 4am every night.
My cat wakes me up at 4 am everyday to feed her by picking at my sheets.
This post really blew up.
To give “her” more happy time.
Sure ;)That’s so adorable!
You sleep in collared shirts?
"My cat does the same, but instead she starts jumping every limb that moves and sits on me or my fiance as a little reminder."
That's precious 😍
Having a pet is like having a kid that stays small and cute and never gives you attitude.
You sleep with a collared shirt?
Awwww you are the best bro a kitty could have!
The things we do for our pets😁
I don't think I've ever seen a cat look so happy.
"This warmed my cold, icy heart."
Thank you.
You wear a collared shirt to bed?
Super adorable.
My puppy does something similar.
"When the alarm goes off he snuggles up, splays out and waits for tummy rubbing to commence."
"No, you set it half hour earlier to giver yourself more happy time with her."
My cat just tries to turn my alarm off cause it annoys him.
Mine does this also.
Alarm time means morning spooning.
"She also knows when it's bed time as she comes in, meows and climbs in to spoon before I go to sleep."
I love our little ritual
She cuddles you when your alarm goes off?
My cat literally screams at me.
They're love screams but still.
This is exactly how my morning goes too!
Loves her poppa!
Doesn't look like a bed time outfit
"My cat learned my first alarm means I'm snoozing at least twice, so she ignored the first one, woke up on second on and sat down next to my head and started staring at me on third one 🙂."
Sometimes she would try to wake me with her paw gently or maybe a bit less gently 🙂
"My cat figured out that the alarm sound means I wake up, and proceeds to sit at the corner of my dresser right in front of my alarm and howls over and over until I get up."
"Yes, I said howl."
Not meow.
"I just lost my cat who wasn’t even 2, but this reminded me of him."
He would do this.
"Whenever the alarm would sound he would run up to my bedroom chirping excitedly (I don’t know why but he didn’t really meow, he chirped like a Pokémon)."
Then he would jump on the bed and snuggle himself up into my armpit with one paw up on me.
"It always made early mornings better, and I loved to hear how excited he was that I was up."
"A+ owner, would cuddle."
What the fuck are you wearing
My kitty does this too!
I moved into my apartment a month ago.
"Because I was traveling so much, I left my Mimis at my parents place."
I brought her home last night and woke up to her purring love all over me.
I am so glad I have her back and need that so much in my life.
"My dog has figured out that the alarm sound means I wake up and give him breakfast, so he stands at the end of the bed growling and barking if I hit snooze."
This is the wholesome shit I signed up for
Not cute at all.
doesnt deserve gold.
You sleep with your clothes?
The fuck are you sleeping in mate?
A sweater?
So cute
The only thing you could do.
My cat equates my alarm to her breakfast time.
You are a great cat daddy!
"Sure, to give 'her' more happy time."
You are training her for a lifetime of morning cuddles!
It's all cute until you're trying to sleep in and she comes in yowling for attention :D
I wish my cats did this.
Usually one hour before my alarm they big the crap out of my girlfriend and I for food
"If my dog notices I slept more that normal he comes to the bedroom and scratches the fuck out of my back, as if he was trying to dig a hole, he loves it when we go out to clean the garden so if I'm late, he won't be patient"
My 80 lbs husky does the same thing!
"He'll lay on the bed at night for about 30 minutes, overheats, and jumps down."
"But without fail, he knows that my alarm clock means I need to get up and is the ONLY time he'll snuggle me all day (except during thunderstorms)."
"That’s nice, my cat is my alarm clock."
"When 4:30 am rolls around, she does wind sprints up and down the bed and then opens my bedside table drawers and pulls everything out."
So you sacrifice 30 mins of your sleep everyday to give her snuggles.
"God bless you, and your family, and you after life x10 lives later."
Omg that is so sweet.
I literally feel like my heart is melting inside.
I cannot handle this cuteness.
I may explode.
My cat knows my alarm too.
She smacks my face with her paw and meows in my ear.
She really looks so happy and at peace!
You're so lucky!
My kitten has been waking me up before my alarms by meowing and dropping toys in my face.
She loves fetch.
"Damn, I wish I was able get my cat to comfortably sleep in the same bed with me."
"I'm too afraid I'll squish him or whatever, and I move around too much."
Plus I need AC or sometimes a fan to sleep comfortably and my cats hate both haha.
My cat hears me roll over in my sleep at 5am and screams until I get up to check his bowl (which is filled with food).
Morning snuggles with your pet is like at least half the meaning of life
How do you even make it out of bed with this thing.
"I can hardly wake up by myself, but this would be the end of me."
"If she's coming over to lie on you when she knows you should be getting up, it's to tell you to get up because she wants her food."
This is blessed
Give who more happy time?
You guys are too much 😁
My cat does this too!
But I think he knows he’s going to get breakfast when I wake up.
cuter to pretend he just really loves me
You are THE BEST.
"It’s okay to admit that it’s your happy time, too"
You sir.
Are a hero!
I just petsat my sister's dog and cats for the past few days.
"Each day, I would wake up looking at one specific cat that decided ""Hey, I'm going to cuddle this human this human when he sleeps."
"""One of the days, I woke up to him kneading on my chest."
Normally I would get annoyed but it was way too cute to get annoyed at.
"Yea my cat used to wait until she saw my eyes open, then she'd come at me."
I miss her very much.
I'd like to link this to everyone who says all cats are assholes.
Oh my goodness 😍😍😍 you're such a sweetheart!
You’re a good cat dad!
You mean YOU ha.
well both more love time.
This absolutely so pure and wholesome.
I simply cannot handle this.
MY HEART OMFGG
That's exactly what I do!
But instead of waking up 30 mins earlier I get outta bed 30mins late xD
Okay but this is legitimately the cutest thing I've ever heard and my heart just burst.
This is exactly what my cat does!
"He snuggles the same way, too!"
They're so sweet.
and sneaky.
This is awesome.
My cat does the same.
"She is my ""snooze preventer""."
"I think you're both getting happy time there, mate."
"Ah, i see, you're a fellow Man of water culture aswell"
A man who loves cats is a good man.
My cat is my alarm.
Some days I'm tempted to snooze.
I cannot.
"Men like you are hard to find, hold on tight an give her all the love she wants"
Incredibly cute and adorable.
My cat does the same ☺️.
Miss it on mornings she’s snuggled up with the kids
This is what my ginger girl does too!
"When my cat learned the alarm sound meant we'd get up, she figured out that if she turned it off, we wouldn't."
We had to get a new alarm clock.
"My little buddy does this just before the alarm goes off because somehow he knows, but he also instead of snuggling likes to cuddle up to my head on my pillow and pull on my beard."
So you’ve got the better deal haha
"Technically, she probably started off as ""what the heck is that noise?"
I should investigate.
""" Which was quickly followed by, ""Oh, my human is here and looking perplexed."
I should love them.
"""In any case, finding good cuddle time with a pet is one of the healthiest things you can do in that human/pet relationship."
Congrats!
Give her some extra cuddles and chin/ear scratches from the Internet.
Actually I think the cat is giving you more happy time.
Your cat has trained you well.
Good guy OP trading 30 minutes of sleep for cat snuggle.
"My cat sleeps on my arm all night, and tries to ""hold me down"" with her tiny paw as soon as I wake up."
"Fun part is when I try to take my arm away, she stretches long and extends her paw all the way as if to say ""stay down hooman, just a little bit longer""!"
Lucky you!
Mine just jumps on my head demanding breakfast while I hit snooze.
My cat only eats and poops.
And sometimes eats his poop.
I recently took in two kittens from a litter that my fathers cat had and in the last few months they have been doing the same.
They will sleep with me all night but as soon as my alarm goes off they are trying to cuddle extra hard.
I would be a liar if I said it wasn’t because of them that I have called off in the past.
I love them so much!
To give whom more happy time?
Maybe you!
You look pretty happy!
You are a good cat parent <3I have two cats myself and both sleep at the foot of my bed.
"One of them will always come for morning snuggles when the sun starts shinning, and she lets me know its time by pawing at my nose and then my blankets."
"Once shes cuddled up next to my tummy she starts purring, sending me back to sleep, whilst her sister comes and lies against my back, effectively making me the middle of a cat sandwich."
"I wake up happy every morning now, and it starts of a majority of my days to be great."
Love those purritos so much.
"Good night, I'm off to snuggle my girls!"
30 minutes everyday?
"So, after two weeks you just don't sleep anymore?"
My cat knows what time my alarm goes off but still starts meowing in my face an hour before because she is hungry.
"What an asshole, but I love her"
Hahahahhahahah this is great.
"My alarm starts by turning on the lights so as soon as the lights turn on, he jump on me and I wake up from his loud purring and he occasionally drools on my face."
i wish my cat liked to snuggle like this - i got her at one years old and while she LOVES to snuggle and be close to me - she doesn't like to lay on me like this :( she'll just lay next to me and make sure she's touching.
Or if she lays on me she'll just be perched on my tummy.
THIS IS SO MUCH CUTER.
I have melted into the floor if any one ask about my whereabouts.
I had to make the decision put Mr.
Kitty down last week and this hits hard in the feels.
Awww she's smiling
"The only thing my cat tells me is ""get and feed me"""
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life
This is the man I love
if this ain’t the cutest fucking thing in the world idk what is
my kitty does the same!
its actually my favorite part of my day :')
Where do you people find all these incredibly sweet and loving cats.
I feel like I'm being graced by their presence when my two cats sit on the same couch or bed as me.
"Mine does it too, but to my wife."
"When she notices we are awake, she comes up there to my wife's face, lays on wife's neck, like a scarf or a collar and purrs her into sleep again."
"This is so nice and cute to watch, it's almost painful."
My cats hear the alarm and know it’s time to eat!
Fatties.
My cat does this too!
It starts the day off right :)
My dog and I have cuddle time every morning and honestly my life has improved so much <3
"Why only 30 minutes early, what the hell is wrong with you!"
"This is probably bs, what kind of psychopath wears a collard shirt to bed?"
"Dude, best thing ever."
Nothing like spending time with those that matter
Why do you sleep in a polo?
That is fucking precious!
Aww cute
Good hooman
I would trade my soul for a kitty like that
You are wonderful
My cat just fuckin meows and meows until I get up to feed his fat ass
"so cute, my cat would do this with my wife all the time in the exact same manor."
"As a super allergic guy i gotta ask, is there a downside to having a cat beside the few $$$ you put for food ?"
Setting aside cuddle time is such a considerate thing to do for your kitty!
Whoever said cats dont love have not had a cat.
Mine would put a claw int my skull top once we settled down just to keep me close in bed.
I had her 15 years.
I loved her and she loved me.
I don't know how this cat can get any cuter.
Awww that's adorable <3    My big furry boy somehow knows when the alarm is about to go off.
More often than not he'll sit on the bedside table beside my head and 'mrow?
' gently.
I love it.
My furry alarm <3
CUTE.
You’re a good cat daddy!
"I don't like cats, but I like this."
I will begin training my dog.
This is so wholesome♡♡
Mine do this!
"They tag team, one sits on my phone to muffle the alarm, one sits on my chest/face to keep me stuck on the bed."
It’s a horrible insurrection and I love every second.
I have nothing to add but envy.
"You're a good person, OP."
You Sir are marriage material!
"If you are already married, please inform your wife she won the lottery with you!"
If you are not married.
there are some lucky ladies out there!
"You, my friend, are everything that’s RIGHT in this world."
Not all heroes wear capes.
My heart is exploding kittens
A small price to pay for salvation.
My husband get up for work an hour before I do.
"So every morning just as he’s going downstairs, my kitty jumps up in bed for snuggles."
heartwarming
Giving *her* more happy time?
That is the cutest thing.
I just got fired from a serving job over a few very greedy people and am feeling down.
"Needed to see this, very sweet."
"“to give her more happy time” bullshit, you do it for the cuddles."
you need those cuddles.
This is too cute!
Aww that was sooo cuuute
"If you don't have a spouse, and would like to marry, show any person you fancy this post."
Damn.
Cute.
My cat associated my alarm with feeding time so he slams his food bowl around.
"Same concept only he doesn't want to cuddle me, he sees me as a feeding device."
"I used to do that with our Manx, Elmo."
Turns out it just wanted to go for my jugular.
"Also, renamed it Spawn of Satan."
Eventually had to get rid of it cuz it would latch onto my child's leg and tear the flesh from his bones.
Pure evil.
I usually get up to pee in the middle of the night.
Getting out of bed requires me to slough the three cats off of me like a climbing out of a pile of leaves.
At that point the three buttheads decide they've had enough sleep for the night and are ready to ruckus.
That's why they are usually exiled after my midnight wee.
"When our youngest (""your cat"" my wife calls him) hears my alarm go off he decides he's  been separated from me for too long and stands at the door crying and scratching until I let him in."
"We cuddle, and scratch for ten minutes or so, then I get to snooze for another twenty minutes before the actual alarm goes."
"TL;DR:  I have two alarms set so that my baby-cat, the needy one, can come get snuggles, we can fall back asleep for twenty minutes, and then I can wake up when I actually need to."
"My kitten is 6 months old, me & my husband adore her, she is very clingy, basically when we are at home she is always with us, even if we’re at home all day."
"That’s fun, my cat just licks my face at 5:50 every morning about 10 mins before my alarm goes off to wake me up."
Wouldn’t bother me so much but I got an automatic feeder for weekends and he still insists on waking me up on Saturday and Sunday at 5:50 even though his food is automatically dispensed at 6.
My dog has learned that the text tone I use for my mom usually means she’s almost home.
She always gets excited when it goes off.
A small price to pay for salvation
My cat just starts knocking shit over after my alarm goes off
You are the best kind of human
Thats so damn cute.
My cat hears my alarm and pokes me in the eyes.
It's rude as fuck.
My cat learned that she didn't have to wait for the alarm and could just yell at me to wake up and feed her.
"As a person that loves cats but is allergic to them,I'm extremely jealous."
"Man, mine just meows about breakfast and bites me if I'm not quick enough."
Mine does almost the same thing!
"I have several morning alarms because I'm the opposite of a morning person, and he gets into bed an hour before my alarms start going off and cuddles with me until I have to get up."
He doesn't do it in the summer because it's too hot and it makes me sad because I love our morning ritual.
My dog does this.
"Every morning at 5, even on weekends."
They know how to work their cuteness.
My cat takes the alarm to mean it's almost time for breakfast and just begins shrieking ceaselessly until I get up and feed him.
I can no longer set early alarms to snooze because he will lose his shit if I don't get up.
This is me but with butt snuggles with my husband ❤
Ahhhh god.
the cuteness.
My black heart.
melting.
you gave me a smile.
take an upvote in return
It's true.
"""Real men are kind to animals""."
My kitty does this too!
Orange tabby.
However when I hit snooze and fall back asleep he leaves and comes back when it goes off again.
My cat does this!
I have to extricate myself from the situation to get up on time.
"This isnt actually me and pineapple, but she and I have morning snuggies that look identical to this."
Flooped on her side on my chest with her cute little head pressed against mine.
SOLID HUMAN BEHAVIOR
My cat wakes me up in the morning by shoving his paw in my mouth.
He is trying to tell me to feed him.
That’s right I get woken up to the taste of fresh cat paw.
My kitty girl does the same thing!
"Hears the alarm, then waits to see my eyes open 😍 makes it very hard to get out of bed."
Everybody liked that
mine just gets in my face and meows.
she made the mistake of standing between me and my alarm the other day and got yeeted across my bedside table when i went to hit the snooze
Awww that's cute that your cats waits until your alarm goes off.
My kitty will sit at the door an hour before my alarm and meow for food.
It drives me nut but I love her to bits.
There's a joy that comes from just chilling with your cat in bed that's like no other.
If I wake up and mine is there we lazily play a game to see who can put a hand/paw on top of the other's the most.
A game we started when I got him as a kitten and it's never ended.
The only reason I would ever wake up earlier Like if you agree Ps:don’t mind my username I also like cats
Mine does that too!
She realized I snooze at least once and lay in bed half awake.
She comes over for cuddles and begins purring so loudly that she wakes up my SO.
I’ve started taking her over to the sofa and we cuddle for another while until she gets distracted by something.
It’s become our little morning ritual.
My dog learned that the sound of me picking up my glasses means I'm getting up and always goes and waits by the bedroom door happily ready to start the day
My sisters cat once figured out how to turn the alarm off.
"Mine also did that and then when my friends would cat/house sit, he would do it to them too."
"When he died suddenly,  a surprising amount of my friends were also devastated."
Cats are such special creatures.
"My cat does the same, though the nap function doesn't work."
What a wonderful cat daddy you are!
"Oh, true love, hey."
My cat also learned about the alarm only she sits on my head and meows until I feed her.
You are a good man!
"You're lucky, mine hear the alarm which signals them to sing the International Cat Anthem aka "" FEED ME RIGHT MEOW!"
One of my kitties does the same thing!
He sees I'm awake so he jumps on the bed and lays on my chest.
"It's a cross between showing love now that I'm awake to pet him, and showing me who's boss by pinning me down when I'm vulnerable."
My cat used to slap me on the cheek with her paw to wake me up.
No claws just toe beans.
Every damn morning my one cat does this.
As soon as I wake up (with or without an alarm) she plops on my chest and demands to be pet for at least 5 minutes.
It's a good way to wake up.
And plus it's her time - my other cat wants night cuddles only.
That is beautiful of your puppy cat
"I don't know you, but I like you."
Because that's what hero's do
"So I don't know if anyone else experiences this, but I have fast internet over my wifi, but for some reason like 99% of gifs just refuse to load."
So I switch to 4g and everything suddenly works.
Anything that causes this?
"Using it in someone elses home would be flexing, using it in your own home is just admitting that your wifi is bad"
"*has unlimited data*I'm sorry, is this some sort of peasant joke that I'm too rich to understand?"
The cable in my area is a joke.
literally.
"""Don't sneeze, or the cable will go out!"
"""Well, it *used* to feel like a joke."
"We have fiber optic in my area, but nobody will service the line for us, so we browse on mobile data every day"
I use my data all the time.
"I pay for it, why not use it and let pc and TV etc have the bandwidth?"
\*laughs in Australian\*\*cries in Australian\*
"that's not a flex, that's survival instinct."
I'm doing it right now
Us Aussies know this feeling all too well.
Our Internet is generally gutter trash.
"Statistically speaking, Australia's internet is worse in comparison to Kenya!"
India doesn't get the joke
Laughs in india
You need to adjust your network.
I don't even understand what flex means anymore.
NA joke
*laughs in Finnish*
In Australia a lot of people do this.
Our internet sucks so bad.
Do some countries still have limited data plans or something?
Cause why would I bother switching to wifi on my phone when I have equally fast mobile data?
"Lol I'm doing it right now, because some idiot (me) used up all the allotted bandwidth playing CSGO and streaming Netflix+Prime (even though I have local copies of the same shows/movies)."
"WiFi is now limited to 1Mbps till the end of the billing cycle, and LTE here is 5MBps usually"
Welp.
in my country everyone has unlimited data.
"I'm in my bed, not on WiFi right this instant."
*laughs in European*
#australia
Now i feel weird
The biggest flex is having good wifi in the first place
"My phone data is unlimited, by my home internet has a data cap."
No its not
god bless jio
Not in Europe
"""Yeah!"
My wifi sucks!
Unless you're Australian and it's a weeknight
Only reason I have unlimited is because on the family plan we are on my 13 y/o brother can’t seem to help himself.
He always took half the data and my mom just got sick of it.
I’m not complaining.
I do this so much.
Haha i do that
Having 20 GB of data a month (5 euro) literally means than i can forget that i have it on and not care.
I have TRIED to use all of it by watching full blown movies and somehow still was left with more than a gigabyte left.
The biggest flex is moving to a neoighborhood that has Google Fi because your wifi is slow.
"Vodafone UK has just announced unlimited, unthrottled data for £30/month soooo."
How the hell do you have 105k upvotes?
Waiting in line for days to buy a new release iPhone to then smash it in front of everyone still queueing is a bigger flex
The biggest flex against who?
Your mobile company?
Your internet service provider?
Your router manufacturer?
Yourself?
This is a lame post.
Bigger than having decent WiFi?
Such an Australian mood.
"Also called being Australian, and it is definitely not a flex"
Or you just live in Australia
What is this sorcery.
How did you know?
Welcome to Australia
Did this all weekend.
This is just called being Australian
I'm doing that right now
When they both said ‘OOooOo Weeee’ so cutee
They both deserve a sticker and a lollipop!
I love that the dad also has stickers on his leg.
So wholesome
"""That thing hurt a little bit huh""He really sold it."
"Great job, now go get some ice cream you two!"
‘A’ grade parenting.
That’s adorable.
I love this man!
Great father.
And now she can do this with her kids one day since she will live past 4.
This is awesome 👏!
What a good daddy!
This had me smiling the whole way through but the stickers on their legs really made it
Way to parent.
Dad looks like Idris Elba.
Can we take one second and applaud that man for enduring the pain of pulling out leg hair when he took those stickers off his leg.
"Museum quality parenting, right there!"
These are the kind of parents that raise good kids.
The kind that isnt afraid to stoop down to their level.
Way too many people have kids expecting them to magically be mini adults
What a wonderful dad!
This is so sweet and heartwarming.
This is a great idea.
Never even thought of this.
What a super dad.
This made my day!
Tooo cute ❤️
Best dad
This right here is amazing.
"You good sir , are an excellent father."
Awesome dad !
And she'll grow up to be an awesome Woman.
This father is awesome
Good looking strong black man who is great with his daughter.
Shit I’d do anything for him too and I’m a straight happily married man.
The kind of nurse can make all the difference.
I've never been bad with needles and hardly feel any pain when having a blood sample drawn.
But some vaccinations have been painful and some have been without pain at all as if my skin had not even been touched.
I recall one nurse punching the meat of the upper arm and felt nothing at all.
WHAT A GOOD DAD 💗
It is so nice to see dads doing their best to raise their children (especially daughters).
Cheers to all good fathers .
"I’m a  “daddy’s girl”, I know how precious and meaningful moments like this are 💜"
Goddamn what a cool dad
#NotAllHerosWearCapes
About 20 years ago I needed to get stitches in my right ring finger.
A nurse came in and told me about a little girl who needed stitches and asked if I would mind the little girl watching me get my stitches.
She held my hand while I got my stitches and was very pleased when she got 1 more than me.
I wish I had been pretend vaccinated.
Me and my daughter went to get our flu vaccinations together and my Dr asked my 4 year old daughter to push the plunger in while he held the needle in my arm.
Longest 4 seconds of my life.
Absolute unit.
That is some high level dad technique.
Oh my god it worked.
When her father did it first she didn't feel pain.
Dad award goes to.
this dad!
What a great dad!
And cute and brave kid!
Barely flinched.
I'm an adult and I still flinch.
This is so sweet!
Good job dad!
Those stickers are gonna hurt when they come off his legs
Give this man a Daddy award!
Wish we had more men like this in the world!
This is very precious and I love it
Babies & kids aren't scared of things unless you tell them to be.
"This includes doctor's visits, vaccinations, the dentist, spiders & bees*."
Fear is all in the imagination.
Projecting such fears onto a child (or a pet) is not recommended.
"*Unless one is seriously, genuinely allergic."
A small gesture that makes all difference
Dad level is over 9000!
I love this.
Every parent should do this.
Not all super heroes wear capes.
Dad is the best !
That's so cute
Wholesome
What a cutie pie.
"Now, that's how you dad."
That little girl is gonna grow up just right with that papa.
Love the comments in here about people arguing over a fucking bandage color lmao.
When I was this age I cried like a little bitch and my father had to restrain me.
I teach MMA these days.
still have mini-panic attacks around needles.
"Jeez, I wish my ma did that when I needed my vaccines."
"This made my morning, too cute"
I want to like this more than once
"As a nursing student, I want to be like this nurse!"
This probably took just a little more effort than usual but her patient had an awesome experience because of it.
You go girl!
"Fine father, great girl But kudos for the nurse too."
I tried this with my son and the nurse was more than a bit annoyed.
Good job to all in this video
such a sweet Dad.
Omg what a monster.
You can see how he only wants autisms for her daughter.
BIG /s
Fantastic!
Need more examples of good dads these days.
I LOVE this!
That was very nice great dad there
What a great dad!
This just made me really excited to be a dad one day.
Great guy
What an awesome father :)
That is so fucking precious!
He is an amazing dad and she’ll be grateful for that in the future
That’s a great daddy and a great nurse!
(And a brave little girl!
"Awwwh, that father daughter love is too adorable :)"
Such a sweet and beautiful family!
And what a rockstar nurse!
This guy dads.
This might sound like an insult but it's not.
That dude looks like a discount Idris Elba.
What a GREAT Dad!
Parent of the year
This is the meaning of being badass
Awesome!
Mad cute
Quality parenting right there.
He's seems like the world 's greatest dad.
Great dad!
Lots of claps!
Brilliant :)
such a great role model
Makes me wish I had a dad like that!
Genius!
Big girl!
We're all proud of you young lady!
"Not only is it video adorable, I had such a weird nostalgia moment."
"Those cute lacey socks, I used to be so adorable with my little socks too."
Wholesome af.
Made my day!
Good daddo
The way he looks at her at the end has me dying!
So precious!
He loves her and is so proud!
"I love when men show emotions like that, that little girl is going to know how to find a man to treat her right!"
"97% upvoted, I sense 3% anti-vaxx here xD"
Alright now this is proper parenting.
"Proper acting too, lol."
"Excellent parenting aside, that dad is a SUPER FOX."
She’s a lucky kid to have such a kind father.
But how is he going to pretend to have the autism(This was a joke but I will accept the downvotes)
"2 pretend vaccinations, including stickers - that'll be an additional fee of $7499 please."
Seriously one of the cutest things I have ever seen ❤
"I dunno what's wrong with me but I smiled so much, and it warmed the cockles of my heart to the point I *literally* began tearing up lolThat girl's got a good dad."
Oh god they both just became autistic and blind to the fact the earth is flat and outer space doesn't exist.
Don't get vaccinated folks pretend or otherwise.
Aaaaaand crying.
Goddamnit.
What a badass dad
Dad level 100.
Much respect!
Soon-to-be-dad approves this.
You’re an awesome dad.
What a great dad!
This is too cute!
That is a wonderful father!
What a bloke!
That's my kind of dad
Now that is a good dad
This is wholesome
Some parenting done right.
Give this man a lollipop for being awesome.
I love this
Great dad!
So sweet!
Sharing needles makes this vaccination a bit redundant I think.
Will he adopt me?
What a good dad.
I love it.
What a lovely father and daughter duo.
This is genius.
This nurse was so amazing!
Dad too.
Made me smile.
I wish their was a Best Dad award that we could hand out!
Am I the only one who’s absolutely loving the fashion choice of those frilly socks with the high tops?
This man is creative!
This is adorable
She did better than I do with needles and I’m 35!
This is a very smart way to go about it honestly.
And that’s how you Dad
That kid is smiling during her vaccination.
Oh my goodness this is so cute and that Dad is a hero.
I’m absolutely going to steal this move one day
"As someone who was scared of needles up until a few years ago, this is great parenting."
"He made it seem absolutely painless for her, and instead of yelling at her to get over it, he showed her how truly painless it really is!"
Daddy is hot.
He's gorgeous.
Be responsible and vaccinate your parents.
Vaccinate your spawn!
Aww you can tell the girl is worried but trying so hard to stay happy like everyone else around her
Wish I could upvote this a million times.
This is exactly how parenting should be done.
This dude is the greatest dad
Parenting done properly.
"Ugh, this makes me _ridiculously_ happy."
What an awesome dad.
Ah I can’t wait to be a dad someday!
That's so adorable and smart!
Definitely adding this to my list of dad things to do when I have kids  :)
This tactic is very comforting to kids.
I liked watching this and that man is a very good dad
10/10 dad!
Awesome!
"Wow look his biceps, he could break the needle."
He never skips anymuscle-day.
"This is absolutely precious :,)"
Awesome dad
I love everything about this.
"I love that he acknowledges it will hurt a little and recoils, I love her bravery/trust, I love how the nurse is playful and part of it and I love those socks."
This made my Sunday.
Stickers all over his legs too.
This guy knows how to Dad.
"Beautiful, this is so cute 🙏"
[deleted]
first time I got the needle my dad was laughing at me calling me a bitch for crying.
Wish my parents did this stuff.
They knew I was afraid of needles so they threatened to take me to the doctor whenever they thought I was faking being sick.
I haven't had any vaccines since I was 10 because of that.
God damn.
I love a good dad.
I'm crying help hekp
Who’s cutting onions
Awesome dad
wholesome
Hey antivaxx parents!
"Write down some notes, because THIS is good parenting"
The nurse didn’t even change needles smh my head
Great dad.
Great nurse.
Great kid.
Plus a great way to stop preventable diseases
Damn what a good dad and well mannered kid
Not only is this a great way to help your kid not be scared of things.
"But the encouragement he gave his daughter to be ""big and strong"" is beautiful."
"What a shitty dad, giving his kid autism /s because this is sadly needed"
Good parenting is a real joy to watch.
Happy for that family to have a strong family unit and dynamic.
Parenting (and being human) done right.
This is so awesome!
"My parents: “shut the fuck up, that shit don’t hurt."
Stop complaining”
Kid handled that 100x better than I can.
That's so nice of him!
Dad 100
awwwww
Look at all those lovely people supporting that beautiful child.
Love the kiss on dad’s face at the end.
Makes my heart grow
this is the most wholesome video I've seen all day :)
I hope to be as loving of a father as this guy.
Can’t wait!
Am Happy cuz they smart
"A+ daddy-ing, right there."
This is the kind of parenting we need
Such a beautiful family.
You can feel the genuine love through this.
Vaccianating his kid.
That means he wants to keep it.
Idris?
One of the top notch dads the world has to offer :p
"Fuck yeah for loving, supportive and trust encouraging parents!"
Watch antivaxxers get mad over this
I needed that today!
"Great parenting, sir!"
this is why ladies need a loving father in their lives.
"What a great father, why can't my husband be like that?"
Hell yeah dad
That’s awesome!
I should have done that with my boys.
"Oh man, that little kiss at the end just killed me!"
Damn fine parenting.
"The game went from an ""I like what I hear so far"" to an ""I want to fucking co-op with Keanu"""
"Uhhh seeing as the technology exists to do this, can we get a remaster of Path Of Neo?"
Keanu is officially a religion now.
I'm expecting his name in game is K34NV.
I just wanna say that that matrix video game was kind of awesome considering it was never very popular.
The fight combination mechanics were way ahead of its time.
"Edit: Wow, most upvotes I've ever gotten."
Glad to see others enjoyed the game as much as I did.
Looking forward to kicking more ass as Keanu.
You could say it’s.
breathtaking
You know modders are going to make Keanu bangable
Not like we need to digitise him for historical reasons.
The guy’s a vampire.
I LMFAO'd at the youtube comment.
"KEANU:  ""How Much?"
"""CD PROJEKT:  ""YES."
[deleted]
Completely worth it.
Were in the endgame now
Was it a gameplay trailer or is that CG?
This is funny because I recently bought Path of Neo at a flea market for 2$ (perfect condition btw only had 1 fingerprint in the disk) and I've been playing the shit out of it.
"That game needs a remake with like Arkham flow combat or something, like it's good, but it could be better"
Path of Neo.
I remember loving that game when it came out.
"Cause, at the time, I loved doing all the fighting tricks and reliving the better parts of that franchise."
But I loved it right until you get to the ending.
[Where the Wackowski's discuss how they decided to end this game.

Just rubbed me the wrong way.
Someday digital Keanu is bound to gain sentience and him and real Keanu will have to battle it out in the matrix in order to gain the others power.
Wow I just made myself wet just thinking about it.
"His speech after the big reveal was a mix of ""I don't usually do stuff like this"" and ""ah fuck it, might as well ham it the hell up and be a big doofus"" XD"
"The thing on the right though is a cinematic, its not gonna look THAT good in the actual game"
And it just hit me that he's going from one cyberpunk world to another.
"[I don't know, I think the original digitization of Keanu 28 years ago was most triumphant."

"If no one has played Matrix: Path of Neo, do yourself a favor and play it now."
"Amazing game, hilarious meta-commentary, and a weird as shit level involving Praying-Mantises."
Why are you comparing the same image twice?
He was digitized in the Matrix movies.
"I loved it when some dude screamed out to him, ""you're breathtaking!"
""" And he yelled back no you are!"
I swear that's a future meme.
But I was genuinely excited when I saw him and so was the crowd.
Really can't wait for more on the game!
Keanu believe it?
Neo has become a mass murderer in the meantime .
BADASS
Keanu will be the most popular skin for robot friends in the future
"I really wonder what games will look like in 14 years, we obviously can't get the same graphical jump because we're already too far for that, but at the same time things are gonna get better and better and better"
He was first digitised in the Bill and Ted games.
"that's a cinematic cutscene on the right, not actual in-game footage tho."
This is it ladies and gentlemen.
We did it!
Don't wanna mess with the doggo in HD
I don’t want to be that guy but the Cyberpunk 2077 footage is actually a cinematic and not real time game engine.
"If anyone needed to be digitized, it was Keanu!"
I miss The Matrix Online.
Played the beta and loved it.
"Sadly, last I checked, the fan made recreation doesn't seem to be functional."
Neo vs giant Agent Smith megazoid was one of the most memorable video game fights of my childhood.
Wake the fuck up samuraiYou gotta city to burn
Only man I would call Daddy
Right side: E3 2019.
Left side: Release 2020
"Pff, wait until we see graphics in 2077!"
Imagine how great Keanu will look in 14 more years in whatever cool game features him at the time.
Whoa.
Path of neo is immortal and timeless
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
I literally have no idea what this game is about.
*KEANU REEVESING INTENSIFIES*
Is that first image a freeze frame from the Agent Smith mob fight in Matrix Reloaded?
Try 24 years.
There was a Bill and Ted's video game with a digital Keanu.
Fascinating artistic and programming ability
"Wait, did we just put Keanu in the matrix?"
Why everyone love him so much?
I haven't seen much of his movies so I'm outside his loop
This has to be the 30th Keanu post I've seen today.
Celebrity worship is weird.
"I cannot be the only one disappointed at this news, huh?"
I love Keanu and I love CD Project Red but I feel like they did this as a marketing scheme.
"Even if Keanu wanted to do it, this stuff breaks the immersion 100% for players seeking a role-playing experience."
"I was really excited for this but I cant help but feel like its just going to be a ""thing"" now that hes in it."
I feel the fourth wall crumbling already.
i maybe born too late for ww2 .
born too early for ww3 but born just in time for photorealistic Keenu reeve .
what a time to be alive
No one's gonna mention the payday 2 render of Keanu?
Probably for the best tbh.
That matrix game kicked ass.
we've got a computer ram to burn
TBH that Matrix game was sick back in the day.
its a Cinematic Trailer.
That matrix game was ahead of its time
Keanu Reeves is a precious precious reminder that life is good.
"Well yeah, I gotta admit, game characters actually look like the people they're supposed to look like now."
The left one looks more like FPS Russia
Keanu looks amazing in Cyberpunk 2077.
Breathtaking.

APCs then ran over bodies time and time again to make 'pie' and remains collected by bulldozer.
Remains incinerated and then hosed down drains.

For those who want the details of what happened that night.
wikipedia.
"org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests#Clearing_the_square>The earliest casualties occurred as far west as Wukesong, where Song Xiaoming, a 32-year-old aerospace technician, was the first confirmed fatality of the night."
"Several minutes later, when the convoy eventually encountered a substantial blockade somewhere east of the 3rd Ring Road, they opened automatic rifle fire directly at protesters."
"Thanks for this, in another thread a top comment was some guy saying it never happened because he never seen any pictures of all the bodies."
"Well to whoever that was, here you go."

"This picture, along with the pictures of the people being pancaked and sprayed down the gutter should be shared every year."
We owe it to the people who died for their freedoms to never forget that a country used their military to fight their own people over an idea.
"I kinda feel bad, in school we were always shown the pictures of Tiananmen Square, but I have absolutely no clue what the protests were about, AT ALL"
That’s what I don’t get about the whole tank man thing.
Why didn’t they just run him over?
"They were already in the process of killing 10,000 people, why did they stop here?"
"Granted, I’ve done zero research and do not know if they did end up killing the man."
"Reminder that China has 800,000 to 1,000,000 Muslims in concentration camps"
yo wtf my internet just cut out
I heard on the news that the Chinese govrnment said that NO people were killed.

Here’s Arthur Kent’s actual footage from that horrific day 30 years ago.
Why doesn’t anyone talk about China more?
I always hear about how bad the Middle East is or countries in Africa or South America.
China has been doing this shit to their own people for decades.
"To political enemies, to Christians, to Muslims, to girls and to children."
"Yet compared to events in other places of the world, we hear almost nothing from the media or anyone else about the tragedies in China."
Edit: China is also really fucking shitty to animals.
"My friend at work grew up in China and despite reading this, he refuses to believe it happened."
Crazy how brain washed a state can make people.
This is why the other picture is so impressive.
"Despite the massacre, that one dude still put himself alone in front of that tank column."
A dude carrying his groceries home can be a real literal hero.
He was willing to give his life to stand by the right thing simply because it happened in front of him.
Not to show anyone but himself.
"He did what not one of the thousands of military, journalists, and politicians that were present or involved, did."
"There is so much to that picture, it is deeply thought provoking."
But you do need the context to really appreciate it.
Edit: letter
Don’t forget this.

"Have any of you heard of the killing fields in Cambodia, where they killed 3 million men women and children in a few weeks."
"If Tiananmen Square pisses you off, check out the Khmer Rouge and the killing fields of Cambodia."
Lost Earth History that American culture ignores.

Pardon my ignorance but did this accomplish anything?
This protest?
Because that is truly tragic if these people made this sacrifice and it led to nothing.
"[Washington Post recently put out an excellent piece on this, if you want some prospective."

We must never forget that the Chinese government is a truly evil entity.
"If they continue to grow in power, eventually they will threaten our freedom as well."
Fuck China.
Fuck reddit for taking Chinese money.
"Well fuck, 12 years on Reddit and never once seen this version."
Remember too that Disney has one of their theme parks in China which is surprising given that Disney won't operate in places that have laws they don't like.
China puts their Muslim citizens in internment camps too which apparently Disney is cool with.
*China has left the server*
People like to berate and look down on students as naive and too young to know anything.
But students were the ones behind the White Rose movement against Nazi Germany.
"Students were the ones in Tianmen Square, fighting for civil liberties against an oppressive government."
Students were some of the main actors in the civil rights movement.
"Students are some of the important proponents of progress, and that should never be overlooked."
"The fact most don't know is that the killings happened June 4th, and Tank Man happened June 5th."
"When he stood in front of those tanks, the possibilty of the military hatming civilians was not an abstraction and he had no false ideals they wouldn't harm him."
Tank Man was even braver than most know.
All the info should be shared.

"Thanks for posting this, really shows how fucked up the situation was."
China’s government are the terrorist.

"I appreciate Reddit for the fact that as soon as an interest was purchased by the Chinese, people immediately made it their mission to troll with multiple daily Tiannamen Square posts."
"Of course, in this age of disinformation and social media manipulation, you do have to wonder if there's any subtext there, and from what entity."
What picture?
I don't see anything.
I also don't recall anything happening at Tiananmen Square.
"It's like ""Yo why y'all freaking out."
It was the right method.
Look at the cool development we have gained since then.
"Chill, foreign friends."
That never happened.
China is a communist utopia where the government never lies.
&#x200B;Seriously MOTHERFUCK China.
In before someone says the US is worse.
[removed]
Surprised the Chinese influence of Reddit is allowing this to be so high.
Worth noting: That's not even the square.
That's the street near the square.
"The Square was likely much, much worse."
Hey China.
Fuck you.
Come arrest me.
"And fun fact (it's really not fun actually)Chinese government never let the Chinese know that, and whoever tried to post that on the internet would probably be banned and maybe been put in jail."
And that is what horrifies me as a Chinese.
"Yea I know there was a lot of terrifying histories that have been ""banned in China""."
Because government REALLY wanted to pretend that they were perfect and the world was wrong.
This is what makes the “tank man’s” stand extraordinary.
This needs 1 million upvotes.
"I think after all the controversy around this time in history and how passionate many redditor's are about this, it should be pinned to r/all for 24 hours."
To spread as much awareness as possible
