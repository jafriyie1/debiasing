But did they clap at the end?,So inspiring,all
How would I know if the flight has ended if there's no clapping?,So inspiring,all
"I should probably start clapping at the end of train rides, bus stops and taxis reaching their destination to be on the safe side",So inspiring,all
"I'm 6'5""I don't fit in airplane seatsI stand up as soon as the plane hits the gate so that I can go from having my knees crammed into my chest to having straight knees and a hunched back.",So inspiring,all
It's literally just changing my posture as much as the space will allow because I'm in literal pain after a flight.,So inspiring,all
Now they need one for not clapping when the plane lands.,So inspiring,all
I thought this was “El Profesor” from Money Heist.,So inspiring,all
Clearly not an Italian flight.,So inspiring,all
You people will never understand how important it is to be the first person waiting at baggage claim.,So inspiring,all
"But sometimes I just have to stretch my legs after a long-ass flight, and in Economy Class the only way to do that is to stand.",So inspiring,all
The worst part of being on a plane is having to sit so long.,So inspiring,all
Standing is fine as long as you don't block the aisle.,So inspiring,all

"That way no one is waiting on me to get stuff out from the overhead and beneath my seat, also being 6’2 it’s nice to stand after being fettered.",So inspiring,all
What pissed me off as a passenger was when we had a delay and they specifically said for only people that had to meet a connecting flight should get off first and there were only like 5 of us that stayed sitting down.,So inspiring,all
I know those fuckers were just being self-centered.,So inspiring,all
I don’t really have a problem if people want to stand up.,So inspiring,all
"If you have an aisle seat, go ahead and stand up after a long flight.",So inspiring,all
My only problem is people that don’t respect the order of exiting row by row.,So inspiring,all
"Yeah I'm sorry (also not sorry), but the seats are so squished together and uncomfortable that I need to get up after a 4 hour flight.",So inspiring,all
Some of the biggest annoyances are brought on by the airlines themselves.,So inspiring,all
Bruh I do that when I’m window but if I’m Aisle then I don’t wanna piss off the window person who’s trying to leave,So inspiring,all
Fuck this joke!,So inspiring,all
"I stand when the plan stops because I'm 6'5"" and I've been in a cramped seat with my knees pressed against the seat in front of me for two+ hours.",So inspiring,all
I want to stand as soon as I can and I refuse to be shamed for it!,So inspiring,all
Why does this bother people so much?,So inspiring,all
I’ve been sitting for the past 8 hours let me stretch my damn legs,So inspiring,all
[deleted],So inspiring,all
I always stand up as soon as the seat belt light goes off.,So inspiring,all
"I've been sitting in a cramped uncomfortable ""chair"" and I'm ready to stand up and stretch.",So inspiring,all
I can also grab my carry on from the overhead and be ready to walk when the line moves.,So inspiring,all
They should be thanking me for helping move things along.,So inspiring,all
And I never get a seat in the back of a plane.,So inspiring,all
I want to get off that sardine can as soon as possible.,So inspiring,all

I knew this would come in handy some day!,My house burned down...,all
Here's a useful comment I've saved from u/0102030405Hey OP.,My house burned down...,all
"I used to be the guy who worked for insurance companies, and determined the value of every little thing in your house.",My house burned down...,all
The guy who would go head-to-head with those fire-truck-chasing professional loss adjusters.,My house burned down...,all
I may be able to help you not get screwed when filing your claim.,My house burned down...,all
"Our goal was to use the information you provided,  and give the lowest damn value we can possibly justify for your item.",My house burned down...,all
"For instance, if all you say was ""toaster"" -- we would come up with a cheap-as-fuck $4.",My house burned down...,all
"88 toaster from Walmart, meant to toast one side of one piece of bread at a time.",My house burned down...,all
And we would do that for every thing you have ever owned.,My house burned down...,all
"We had private master lists of the most commonly used descriptions, and what the cheapest viable replacements were.",My house burned down...,all
"We also had wholesale pricing on almost everything out there, so really scored cheap prices to quote.",My house burned down...,all
"To further that example:•⁠If you said ""toaster - $25""  , we would have to be within -20% of that.",My house burned down...,all
"so, we would find something that's pretty much dead-on $20.",My house burned down...,all
"•⁠If you said ""toaster- $200"" , we'd kick it back and say NEED MORE INFO, because that's a ridiculous price for a toaster (with no other information given.",My house burned down...,all
")•⁠If you said ""toaster, from Walmart"" , you're getting that $4.",My house burned down...,all
88 one.,My house burned down...,all
"•⁠If you said ""toaster, from Macys"" , you'd be more likely to get a $25-35 one.",My house burned down...,all
"•⁠If you said ""toaster"", and all your other kitchen appliances were Jenn Air / Kitchenaid / etc.",My house burned down...,all
", you would probably get a matching one.",My house burned down...,all
"•⁠If you said ""Proctor Silex 42888 2-Slice Toaster from Wamart, $9"", you just got yourself $9.",My house burned down...,all
"•⁠If you said ""High-end Toaster, Stainless Steel, Blue glowing power button"" .",My house burned down...,all
you might get $35-50 instead.,My house burned down...,all
We had to match all features that were listed.,My house burned down...,all
I'm not telling you to lie on your claim.,My house burned down...,all
Not at all.,My house burned down...,all
"That would be illegal, and could cause much bigger issues (i.",My house burned down...,all
", invalidating the entire claim).",My house burned down...,all
"But on the flip side, it's not always advantageous to tell the whole truth every time.",My house burned down...,all
Pay attention to those last two examples.,My house burned down...,all
I remember one specific customer.,My house burned down...,all
"he had some old, piece of shit projector (from mid-late 90s) that could stream a equally piece of shit consumer camcorder.",My house burned down...,all
Worth like $5 at a scrap yard.,My house burned down...,all
"It had some oddball fucking resolution it could record at, though -- and the guy strongly insisted that we replace with ""Like Kind And Quality"" (trigger words).",My house burned down...,all
"Ended up being a $65k replacement, because the only camera on the market happened to be a high-end professional video camera (as in, for shooting actual movies).",My house burned down...,all
"$65-goddam-thousand-dollars because he knew that loophole, and researched his shit.",My house burned down...,all
Remember to list fucking every -- even the most mundane fucking bullshit you can think of.,My house burned down...,all
"For example, if I was writing up the shower in my bathroom:•⁠Designer Shower Curtain  -  $35•⁠Matching Shower Curtain Liner for Designer Shower Curtain - $15•⁠Shower Curtain Rings x20 - $15•⁠Stainless Steel Soap Dispenser for Shower - $35•⁠Natural Sponge Loofah - from Whole Foods - $15•⁠Natural Sponge Loofah for Back - from Whole Foods - $19•⁠Holder for Loofahs - $20•⁠Bars of soap - from Lush - $12 each (qty: 4)•⁠Bath bomb - from Lush - $12•⁠High end shampoo - from salon - $40•⁠High end conditioner - from salon - $40•⁠Refining pore mask - from salon - $55I could probably keep thinking, and bring it up to about $400 for the contents of my shower.",My house burned down...,all
"Nothing there is ""unreasonable""  , nothing there is clearly out of place, nothing seems obviously fake.",My house burned down...,all
"The prices are a little on the high-end, but the reality is, some people have expensive shit -- it won't actually get questioned.",My house burned down...,all
"No claims adjuster is going to bother nitpicking over the cost of fucking Lush bath bombs, when there is a 20,000 item file to go through.",My house burned down...,all
"The adjuster has other shit to do, too.",My house burned down...,all
Most people writing claims for a total loss wouldn't even bother with the shower (it's just some used soap and sponges.,My house burned down...,all
)  -- and those people would be losing out on $400.,My house burned down...,all
Some things require documentation & ages.,My house burned down...,all
